            The car, and the roads it travels on, will be   21    in the twenty-first century. The key to tomorrow’s “smart cars” will be   22    . “We’ll see vehicles and roads that see and hear and feel and   23    and talk and act,” predicts Bill Spreitzer, technical director of General Motors Corporation's ITS program, which is designing the smart car and road of the future.
       24    40,000 people are killed each year in the United States in traffic accidents. The number of people that are killed or badly injured in car accidents is so   25    that we don’t even bother to   26    them in the newspapers anymore. Fully half of these fatalities come from drunk drivers, and many others from   27    . A smart car could eliminate most of these car accidents. It can sense if a driver is drunk   28    electronic sensors that can pick up alcohol vapor in the air, and refuse to   29    the engine.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Speeding off in a stolen car, the thief thinks he has got a great catch. But he is in for an unwelcome surprise. The car is fitted with a remote immobilizer (锁止器), and a radio signal from a control centre miles away will ensure that once the thief switches the engine off, he will not be able to start it again.
            For now, such devices are only available for fleets of trucks and specialist vehicles used on construction sites. But remote immobilization technology could soon start to trickle down to ordinary cars, and should be available in the UK in two months.
            The idea goes like this. A control box fitted to the car contains a mini-cellphone, a micro-processor and memory, and a GPS satellite positioning receiver. If the car is stolen, a coded cellphone signal will tell the control centre to block the vehicle’s engine management system and prevent the engine being restarted.
            In the UK, a set of technical fixes is already making life harder for car thieves. “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed,” says Martyn Randall, a security expert. He says it would only take him a few minutes to teach a person how to steal a car, using a bare minimum of tools. But only if the car is more than 10 years old.
            Modern cars are far tougher to steal, as their engine management computer won’t allow them to start unless they receive a unique ID code beamed out by the ignition (点火) key. In the UK, technologies like this have helped achieve a 31% drop in vehicle-related crime since 1997.
            But determined criminals are still managing to find other ways to steal cars, often by getting bold of the owner’s keys. And key theft is responsible for 40% of the thefts of vehicles fitted with a tracking system.
            If the car travels 100 meters without the driver confirming their ID, the system will send a signal to an operations centre that it has been stolen. The hundred meters minimum avoids false alarms due to inaccuracies in the GPS signal.
            Staff at the centre will then contact the owner to confirm that the car really is missing, and keep police informed of the vehicle’s movements via the car’s GPS unit.



    31.
    	
    What’s the function of the remote immobilizer fitted to a car?
    A) To help the police make a surprise attack on the car thief.  
    B) To allow the car to lock automatically when stolen.  
    C) To prevent the car thief from restarting it once it stops.  
    D) To prevent car theft by sending a radio signal to the car owner.  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    By saying “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed” (Lines 1-2. Para. 4), Martyn Randall suggests that ________.
    A) it takes a longer time for the car thief to do the stealing  
    B) self-prepared tools are no longer enough for car theft  
    C) the thief has to make use of computer technology  
    D) the thief has lost interest in stealing cars over 10 years old  

    正确答案： B
    33.
    	
    _______________ is essential in making a modem car tougher to steal.
    A) A coded ignition key  
    B) A unique ID card  
    C) A special cellphone signal  
    D) A GPS satellite positioning receiver  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    Why does the tracking system set a 100-metre minimum before sending an alarm to the operations centre?
    A) To leave time for the operations centre to give an alarm.  
    B) To keep police informed of the car’s movements.  
    C) To give the driver time to contact the operations centre.  
    D) To allow for possible errors in the GPS system.  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    What will the operations centre do first after receiving an alarm?
    A) Start the tracking system.  
    B) Contact the car owner.  
    C) Block the car engine.  
    D) Locate the missing car.  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            According to some individuals, if your house is built in the right position, this may affect your success in life, which seems strange to many people. However, to believers in Feng-Shui, or the art of geomancy, not only the position but also the choice of decorations and even the color of your home can mean the difference between good fortune and disaster. This art has been practiced for centuries in China and is still used all over South East Asia. Even the huge Hong Kong banks call in a geomant if they are planning to build new offices.
            Like many Oriental beliefs the geomant’s skill depends on the idea of harmony in nature. If there is no imbalance between the opposing forces of Yin and Yang, the building will bring luck to its inhabitants. This means that the house must be built on the right spot as well as facing the right direction, and also be painted an auspicious color. For instance, if there are mountains to the north, this will protect them from evil influences. If the house is painted red, this will bring happiness to the occupants while green symbolizes youth and will bring long life. The geomant believes that unless all these are considered when choosing a site for construction, the fortune of the people using it will be at risk.
            Indeed, to ignore the geomant’s advice can have fatal results. The death of the internationally famous Kung-Fu star, Bruce Lee, has been used as an example. It is said that when Lee found out that the house he was living in was an unlucky one, he followed a geomant’s advice and installed an eight-sided mirror outside his front door to bring him luck. Unfortunately, a storm damaged the mirror and the house was left unprotected from harmful influences. Soon afterwards Lee died in mysterious circumstances. 　　
            Not only is Feng-Shui still used in South East Asia, but it has also spread right across the world. Even in modern New York a successful commercial artist called Milton Glaser has found it useful. He was so desperate after his office was broken into six times that he consulted a geomant. He was told to install a fish tank with six black fish and fix a red clock to the ceiling. Since then he has not been burglarized once. It may seem an incredible story, but no other suitable explanation has been offered.



    36.
    	
    From the passage we can infer that Feng-Shui is NOT used in ______.
    A) Japan  
    B) New York  
    C) Hong Kong  
    D) China  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    Geomants believe that ______.
    A) houses must only be painted red  
    B) houses must face mountains  
    C) nature and life should be in harmony  
    D) green is an unlucky color  

    正确答案： C
    38.
    	
    Geomants think that the reason for Bruce Lee’s death is that ______.
    A) he didn’t follow the geomants’ advice  
    B) he installed an eight-sided mirror  
    C) he misunderstood the geomant’s advice  
    D) a storm damaged the protection for his house  

    正确答案： D
    39.

    A) colors are not important in geomancy  
    B) geomancy is used in the West
