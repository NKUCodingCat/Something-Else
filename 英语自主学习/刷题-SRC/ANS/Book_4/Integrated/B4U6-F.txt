    Script:         Internet use appears to cause a decline in psychological well-being, according to research at Carnegie Mellon University.
            Even people who spent just a few hours a week on the Internet experienced more depression and loneliness than those who logged on less frequently, the two-year study showed. And it wasn’t that people who were already feeling bad spent more time on the Internet, but that using the Net actually appeared to cause the bad feelings.
            Researchers are puzzling over the results, which were completely contrary to their expectations. They expected that the Net would prove socially healthier than television, since the Net allows users to choose their information and to communicate with others.
            The fact that Internet use reduces time available for family and friends may account for the drop in well-being, researchers hypothesized. Faceless, bodiless “virtual” communication may be less psychologically satisfying than actual conversation, and the relationships formed through it may be shallower. Another possibility is that exposure to the wider world via the Net makes users less satisfied with their lives.
            “But it’s important to remember this is not about the technology; it’s about how it is used,” says psychologist Christine Riley of Intel, one of the study’s sponsors. “It really points to the need for considering social factors in terms of how you design applications and services for technology.”

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Increasingly, over the past ten years, people ― especially young people ― have become aware of the need to change their eating habits, because much of the food they eat, particularly chemical foods, is not good for health. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in natural foods: foods which do not contain chemical additives and which have not been affected by chemical fertilizers, widely used in farming today.
            Natural foods, for example, are vegetables, fruits and grains which have been grown in soil that is rich in organic matter. In simple terms, this means that the soil has been nourished by unused vegetable matter, which provides it with essential vitamins and minerals. This in itself is a natural process compared with the use of chemicals and fertilizers, the main purpose of which is to increase the amount ― but not the quality ― of foods grown in commercial farming areas.
            Natural foods also include animals which have been allowed to feed and move freely in healthy pastures. Compare this with what happens in the mass production of poultry: there are battery farms, for example, where thousands of chickens live crowded together in one building and are fed on food which is little better than rubbish. Chickens kept in this way are not only tasteless as food; they also produce eggs which lack important vitamins.
            There are other aspects of healthy eating which are now receiving increasing attention from experts on diet. Take, for example, the question of sugar. This is actually a non-essential food! Although a natural alternative, such as honey, can be used to sweeten food if this is necessary, we can in fact do without it. It is not that sugar is harmful in itself. But it does seem to be an additive: the quantity we use has grown steadily over the last two centuries and in Britain today each person consumes an average of 200 pounds a year! Yet all it does is provide us with energy, in the form of calories. There are no vitamins in it, no minerals and no fiber.
            It is significant that nowadays fiber is considered to be an important part of a healthy diet. In white bread, for example, the fiber has been removed. But it is present in unrefined flour and of course in vegetables. It is interesting to note that in countries where the national diet contains large quantities of unrefined flour and vegetables, certain diseases are comparatively rare. Hence the emphasis is placed on the eating of whole meal bread and more vegetables by modern experts on healthy eating.



    31.
    	
    Recently, some people are interested in natural foods because ______.
    A) natural foods are fresh and cheap  
    B) they don’t like processed foods  
    C) they want to change their eating habits  
    D) these foods contain more vitamins, mineral and fiber etc.  

    正确答案： D
    32.
    	
    According to the passage, what does the word “battery” (Para. 3) mean? ______
    A) apparatus for producing electricity  
    B) an array of similar things intended for use together  
    C) a line of small boxes in which hens are kept to lay eggs  
    D) a group or set of things like tools  

    正确答案： C
    33.

    A) white bread in which fiber has been removed  
    B) a type of brown bread which is made of unrefined flour  
    C) a kind of bread which can be used to cure diseases  
    D) a loaf of bread filled with hams and chicken  

    正确答案： B
    34.

    B) people will not necessarily do exercises in the future if they eat natural foods  
    C) natural foods will find a good market in the future

    B) Healthy Eating  
    C) Natural Food and Chemical Additives  
    D) How to Go on a Diet  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Our entire human existence is based on change. Our species is dependent upon the advancement of life and our culture. If we were to forever remain the same, without evolving, perhaps our collective existence wouldn’t even be possible. It remains within our individual powers to hold onto the past. We do not have to let technology take hold of us and our lives.
            Seven Birkerts, in his article “Into the Electronic Millennium”, seems to feel as if technology is corrupting, and will continue to corrupt, our culture. In specific, he focuses on literature and language as being the core of what is being corrupted. My question is, how can something be corrupted that is, in fact, already corrupted?
            Language wasn’t created as written expression. Words were invented as personal thoughts that were spoken orally, either to oneself or to an audience. Either way, listeners of words were limited by a storyteller’s own preferences. One could argue that the evolution of oral language into written language has been corrupted by these preferences. Today, language isn’t as personal and limited as in the past. In our era, the printed form of language has merely been converted to an electronic form by technology. Technology loses much of the personal touches that perhaps created language, and the population is now not really limited at all by a storyteller’s preferences, but perhaps this freedom is commendable. The entire world is now open to everything. We all have the opportunity to learn, read, and see whatever we desire.
            The freedom offered by technology shouldn’t be seen as “a destruction of tokens from the past”, as Birkerts seems to believe. It is merely the introduction of a future. The past is just that, the past; we can’t change it. Therefore, it will always be there. It is in a way indestructible. We, society, decide what is neglected in our past and in our culture. The addition of the television did not rid our society of books and outdoor activities as was believed by some. In similar fashion, the advent of the computer does not restrict us as a society to our homes, speaking to virtual others. Birkerts’ view that our society will create another group of hermits and loners simply won’t happen. Humans by nature are social beings. We thrive on the comfort and companionship of other humans. To rid ourselves of that would be too harmful. We will never close ourselves as a whole to others; the costs outweigh the benefits.



    36.
    	
    What does the sentence “It remains within our individual powers to hold onto the past” (Para. 1) mean?
    A) We can’t live in a society full of changes.  
    B) We could live in the past without evolving.  
    C) Human beings can live in the present fashion.  
    D) Human beings can’t live in the old fashion.  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    Nowadays, we have the opportunity to learn and read whatever we desire because _____.
    A) we are not as limited as before due to the advancement of technology  
    B) we have fewer chances to touch the storyteller’s viewpoints directly  
    C) language also develops with the advancement of technology  
    D) language isn’t influenced by the storyteller’s preferences  

    正确答案： A
    38.

    B) The computer does not restrict us as a society to our homes.  
    C) The freedom offered by technology is a destruction of the past.

    正确答案： C
    39.

    D) The advancement of technology can’t influence culture.  

    正确答案： B
