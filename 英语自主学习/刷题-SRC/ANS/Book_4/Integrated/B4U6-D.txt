    Script:         The family is changing. In the past, grandparents, parents, and children used to live together, and they had an extended family. But family structure is changing throughout the world. The nuclear family consists of only one father, one mother, and children; it is becoming the main family structure everywhere.
            The nuclear family offers married women some advantages: they have freedom from their relatives, and the husband does not have all the power of the family. Studies show that in nuclear families, men and women usually make an equal number of decisions about family life.
            But wives usually have to “pay” for the benefits of freedom and power. When women lived in extended families, sisters, grandparents and aunts helped one another with housework and childcare. In addition, older women in a large family group had important positions. Wives in nuclear families do not often enjoy this benefit, and they have another disadvantage, too: women generally live longer than their husbands, so older women from nuclear families often have to live alone. Studies show that women are generally less satisfied with marriage than men are. In the past, men worked outside the home and women worked inside. Housework and childcare were a full time job, and there was no time for anything else. Now women work outside and have more freedom than they did in the past, but they still have to do most of the housework. The women actually have two full-time jobs, and they have not much free time.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Increasingly, over the past ten years, people ― especially young people ― have become aware of the need to change their eating habits, because much of the food they eat, particularly chemical foods, is not good for health. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in natural foods: foods which do not contain chemical additives and which have not been affected by chemical fertilizers, widely used in farming today.
            Natural foods, for example, are vegetables, fruits and grains which have been grown in soil that is rich in organic matter. In simple terms, this means that the soil has been nourished by unused vegetable matter, which provides it with essential vitamins and minerals. This in itself is a natural process compared with the use of chemicals and fertilizers, the main purpose of which is to increase the amount ― but not the quality ― of foods grown in commercial farming areas.
            Natural foods also include animals which have been allowed to feed and move freely in healthy pastures. Compare this with what happens in the mass production of poultry: there are battery farms, for example, where thousands of chickens live crowded together in one building and are fed on food which is little better than rubbish. Chickens kept in this way are not only tasteless as food; they also produce eggs which lack important vitamins.
            There are other aspects of healthy eating which are now receiving increasing attention from experts on diet. Take, for example, the question of sugar. This is actually a non-essential food! Although a natural alternative, such as honey, can be used to sweeten food if this is necessary, we can in fact do without it. It is not that sugar is harmful in itself. But it does seem to be an additive: the quantity we use has grown steadily over the last two centuries and in Britain today each person consumes an average of 200 pounds a year! Yet all it does is provide us with energy, in the form of calories. There are no vitamins in it, no minerals and no fiber.
            It is significant that nowadays fiber is considered to be an important part of a healthy diet. In white bread, for example, the fiber has been removed. But it is present in unrefined flour and of course in vegetables. It is interesting to note that in countries where the national diet contains large quantities of unrefined flour and vegetables, certain diseases are comparatively rare. Hence the emphasis is placed on the eating of whole meal bread and more vegetables by modern experts on healthy eating.



    31.
    	
    Recently, some people are interested in natural foods because ______.
    A) natural foods are fresh and cheap  
    B) they don’t like processed foods  
    C) they want to change their eating habits  
    D) these foods contain more vitamins, mineral and fiber etc.  

    正确答案： D
    32.
    	
    According to the passage, what does the word “battery” (Para. 3) mean? ______
    A) apparatus for producing electricity  
    B) an array of similar things intended for use together  
    C) a line of small boxes in which hens are kept to lay eggs  
    D) a group or set of things like tools  

    正确答案： C
    33.
    	
    The phrase “whole meal bread” in Para.5 refers to ______.
    A) white bread in which fiber has been removed  
    B) a type of brown bread which is made of unrefined flour  
    C) a kind of bread which can be used to cure diseases  
    D) a loaf of bread filled with hams and chicken  

    正确答案： B
    34.
    	
    It can be inferred from the passage that ______.
    A) people will no longer eat those foods containing chemical additives  
    B) people will not necessarily do exercises in the future if they eat natural foods  
    C) natural foods will find a good market in the future  
    D) certain diseases will never befall people who eat natural foods  

    正确答案： C
    35.

    A) Eating Habits Are Changing  
    B) Healthy Eating

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            The quality of university life is declining under strain from the higher education, leading independent schools in Britain complained. The warning followed survey of the impressions of campus life gained by students of school. Poor interviewing of the applicants, infrequent contact with tutors, worries over student safety, and even complaint over the food were all seen as symptoms of the pressure on universities. Head teachers said that standards could well drop if the squeeze on university budgets continued. A survey was carried out because of fears that the level of green area in universities had declined. A great number of student suicides had raised concerns among head teachers.
            Although most of the 6,000 students surveyed were enjoying university life, almost a third were less than satisfied with their course. About one in 10 had serious financial problems and some gave alarming accounts of conditions around their halls of residence. Incidents mentioned included a fatal stabbing and shooting outside a hall of residence, the petrol-bombing of cars near another residence, and two racist attacks. Nine percent of women and seven percent of men rated security as unsatisfactory in the area where they lived. Salford University had the lowest satisfaction rating. Lancaster and Kingston universities were rated the safest.
            The survey confirmed head teachers’ fears about contact between students and tutors slipping, with a quarter of the students seeing their tutors only every three weeks. New students, used to regular contact with their teachers, found it hard to adapt to the change. Interview techniques were a cause for concern, with the school calling for more training of university staff involved in admissions. Some headmasters complained that interviews were increasingly “odd”. One greeted an applicant by throwing him an apple. Another interview lasted only three minutes. About a quarter of the students found the workload at university heavier than they had expected. Imperial College London, Oxford and Cambridge universities registered by far the highest workload. There were differences between subjects, with architecture, engineering, veterinary science, medicine and some science subjects demanding the most work. Veterinary science was nevertheless the most popular subject, followed by physiotherapy and history of art. General engineering, economics, computing and sociology were the least popular. The survey also confirmed previous concerns about possible racial prejudice in admissions to medical courses. Applicants with names suggesting an ethnic minority background had been rejected with qualifications as good as successful white candidates.



    36.
    	
    According to the passage, the main problem existing in the interview of admission is that ______.
    A) the interviewers often greeted the applicants by throwing an apple  
    B) the interviewers spent only a few minutes interviewing an applicant
