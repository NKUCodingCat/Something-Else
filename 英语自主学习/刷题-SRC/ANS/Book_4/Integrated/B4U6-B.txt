    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

    Script:         Internet use appears to cause a decline in psychological well-being, according to research at Carnegie Mellon University.
            Even people who spent just a few hours a week on the Internet experienced more depression and loneliness than those who logged on less frequently, the two-year study showed. And it wasn’t that people who were already feeling bad spent more time on the Internet, but that using the Net actually appeared to cause the bad feelings.
            Researchers are puzzling over the results, which were completely contrary to their expectations. They expected that the Net would prove socially healthier than television, since the Net allows users to choose their information and to communicate with others.
            The fact that Internet use reduces time available for family and friends may account for the drop in well-being, researchers hypothesized. Faceless, bodiless “virtual” communication may be less psychologically satisfying than actual conversation, and the relationships formed through it may be shallower. Another possibility is that exposure to the wider world via the Net makes users less satisfied with their lives.
            “But it’s important to remember this is not about the technology; it’s about how it is used,” says psychologist Christine Riley of Intel, one of the study’s sponsors. “It really points to the need for considering social factors in terms of how you design applications and services for technology.”

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            The quality of university life is declining under strain from the higher education, leading independent schools in Britain complained. The warning followed survey of the impressions of campus life gained by students of school. Poor interviewing of the applicants, infrequent contact with tutors, worries over student safety, and even complaint over the food were all seen as symptoms of the pressure on universities. Head teachers said that standards could well drop if the squeeze on university budgets continued. A survey was carried out because of fears that the level of green area in universities had declined. A great number of student suicides had raised concerns among head teachers.
            Although most of the 6,000 students surveyed were enjoying university life, almost a third were less than satisfied with their course. About one in 10 had serious financial problems and some gave alarming accounts of conditions around their halls of residence. Incidents mentioned included a fatal stabbing and shooting outside a hall of residence, the petrol-bombing of cars near another residence, and two racist attacks. Nine percent of women and seven percent of men rated security as unsatisfactory in the area where they lived. Salford University had the lowest satisfaction rating. Lancaster and Kingston universities were rated the safest.
            The survey confirmed head teachers’ fears about contact between students and tutors slipping, with a quarter of the students seeing their tutors only every three weeks. New students, used to regular contact with their teachers, found it hard to adapt to the change. Interview techniques were a cause for concern, with the school calling for more training of university staff involved in admissions. Some headmasters complained that interviews were increasingly “odd”. One greeted an applicant by throwing him an apple. Another interview lasted only three minutes. About a quarter of the students found the workload at university heavier than they had expected. Imperial College London, Oxford and Cambridge universities registered by far the highest workload. There were differences between subjects, with architecture, engineering, veterinary science, medicine and some science subjects demanding the most work. Veterinary science was nevertheless the most popular subject, followed by physiotherapy and history of art. General engineering, economics, computing and sociology were the least popular. The survey also confirmed previous concerns about possible racial prejudice in admissions to medical courses. Applicants with names suggesting an ethnic minority background had been rejected with qualifications as good as successful white candidates.



    31.
    	
    According to the passage, the main problem existing in the interview of admission is that ______.
    A) the interviewers often greeted the applicants by throwing an apple  
    B) the interviewers spent only a few minutes interviewing an applicant  
    C) the interviewers were not knowledgeable to interview the applicants  
    D) the interviewers lack enough training and interview techniques

    B) had regular contact with their teachers  
    C) were often dissatisfied with their course  
    D) were worried about their entrance exam  

    正确答案： B
    33.

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Our entire human existence is based on change. Our species is dependent upon the advancement of life and our culture. If we were to forever remain the same, without evolving, perhaps our collective existence wouldn’t even be possible. It remains within our individual powers to hold onto the past. We do not have to let technology take hold of us and our lives.
            Seven Birkerts, in his article “Into the Electronic Millennium”, seems to feel as if technology is corrupting, and will continue to corrupt, our culture. In specific, he focuses on literature and language as being the core of what is being corrupted. My question is, how can something be corrupted that is, in fact, already corrupted?
            Language wasn’t created as written expression. Words were invented as personal thoughts that were spoken orally, either to oneself or to an audience. Either way, listeners of words were limited by a storyteller’s own preferences. One could argue that the evolution of oral language into written language has been corrupted by these preferences. Today, language isn’t as personal and limited as in the past. In our era, the printed form of language has merely been converted to an electronic form by technology. Technology loses much of the personal touches that perhaps created language, and the population is now not really limited at all by a storyteller’s preferences, but perhaps this freedom is commendable. The entire world is now open to everything. We all have the opportunity to learn, read, and see whatever we desire.
            The freedom offered by technology shouldn’t be seen as “a destruction of tokens from the past”, as Birkerts seems to believe. It is merely the introduction of a future. The past is just that, the past; we can’t change it. Therefore, it will always be there. It is in a way indestructible. We, society, decide what is neglected in our past and in our culture. The addition of the television did not rid our society of books and outdoor activities as was believed by some. In similar fashion, the advent of the computer does not restrict us as a society to our homes, speaking to virtual others. Birkerts’ view that our society will create another group of hermits and loners simply won’t happen. Humans by nature are social beings. We thrive on the comfort and companionship of other humans. To rid ourselves of that would be too harmful. We will never close ourselves as a whole to others; the costs outweigh the benefits.



    36.
    	
    What does the sentence “It remains within our individual powers to hold onto the past” (Para. 1) mean?
    A) We can’t live in a society full of changes.  
    B) We could live in the past without evolving.  
    C) Human beings can live in the present fashion.  
    D) Human beings can’t live in the old fashion.  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    Nowadays, we have the opportunity to learn and read whatever we desire because _____.
    A) we are not as limited as before due to the advancement of technology  
    B) we have fewer chances to touch the storyteller’s viewpoints directly  
    C) language also develops with the advancement of technology  
    D) language isn’t influenced by the storyteller’s preferences  

    正确答案： A
    38.

    B) The computer does not restrict us as a society to our homes.  
    C) The freedom offered by technology is a destruction of the past.

    正确答案： C
    39.

    C) We can gain nothing from the advancement of technology.  
    D) The advancement of technology can’t influence culture.  

    正确答案： B
    40.
    	
    What is the author’s idea about language?
    A) The change of the world has nothing to do with language.  
    B) The change of language resulted in society corruption.  
    C) Computers and televisions should be thrown away for their undesirable influence on language.  
    D) We don’t have to worry about the influence of technology on language.
