    Script:         In America, people are faced with more and more decisions every day, whether it’s picking one of thirty-one ice cream flavors or deciding whether and when to get married. That sounds like a great thing, but as a recent study has shown, too many choices can make us confused, unhappy, even paralyzed with indecision. “That’s particularly true when it comes to the work place”, says Barry Schwartz, an author of six books about human behavior. Students are graduating with a variety of skills and interests, but often find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to choosing an ultimate career goal. In a study, Schwartz observed decision-making among college students during their senior year. Based on answers to questions regarding their job hunting strategies and career decisions, he divided the students into two groups: maximizers, who consider every possible option, and satisfiers, who look until they find an option that is good enough. You might expect that the student who had undertaken the most exhausted search would be the most satisfied with their final decision, but it turns out that’s not true. Schwartz found that while maximizers ended up with better-paying jobs than satisfiers on average, they weren’t as happy with their decision. The reason why these people feel less satisfied is that a world of possibilities may also be a world of missed opportunities. When you look at every possible option, you tend to focus more on what was given up than what was gained. After surveying every option, a person is more acutely aware of the opportunities they had to turn down to pursue just one career.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Job sharing refers to the situation in which two people divide the responsibility of one full-time job. The two people willingly act as part-time workers, enough hours between them to fulfill the duties of a full-time worker. If they each work half the job, for example, they each receive 50 percent of the job’s wages, its holidays and its other benefits. Of course, some job sharers take a smaller or larger share of the responsibilities of the position, receiving a lesser or greater share of the benefits.
            Job sharing differs from conventional part-time work in that it occurs mainly in the more highly skilled and professional areas, which require higher levels of responsibility and employee commitment. Job sharing should not be confused with the term work sharing, which refers to increasing the number of jobs by reducing the number of hours of each existing job, thus offering more positions to the growing number of unemployed people. Job sharing, by contrast, is not designed to address unemployment problems; its focus, rather, is to provide well-paid work for skilled workers and professionals who want more free time for other activities.
            As would be expected, women constitute the bulk of job sharers. A survey carded out in 1988 by Britain’s Equal Opportunities Commission revealed that 78 per cent of sharers were female, the majority of whom were between 20 and 40 years of age. Subsequent studies have come up with similar results. Many of these women were re-entering the job market after having had children, but they chose not to seek part-time work because it would have meant lower status.
            Job sharing also offered an acceptable shift back into full-time work after a long absence. The necessity of close cooperation when sharing a job with another person makes the actual work quite different from conventional one-position jobs. However, to ensure a greater chance that the partnership will succeed, each person needs to know the strengths, weaknesses and preferences of his or her partner before applying for a position. Moreover, there must be a fair division of both routine tasks and interesting ones. In sum, for a position to be job-shared well, the two individuals must be well matched and must treat each other as equals.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Taking charge of yourself involves putting to rest some very prevalent myths. At the top of the list is the notion that intelligence is measured by your ability to solve complex problems; to read, write and compute at certain levels; and to resolve abstract equations quickly. This vision of intelligence asserts formal education and bookish excellence as the true measures of self fulfillment. It encourages a kind of intellectual prejudice that has brought with it some discouraging results. We have come to believe that someone who has more educational merit badges, who is very good at some form of school discipline is “intelligent.” Yet mental hospitals are filled with patients who have all of the properly lettered certificates. A truer indicator of intelligence is an effective, happy life lived each day and each present moment of every day.
            If you are happy, if you live each moment for everything it’s worth, then you are an intelligent person. Problem solving is a useful help to your happiness, but if you know that given your inability to resolve a particular concern you can still choose happiness for yourself, or at a minimum refuse to choose unhappiness, then you are intelligent. You are intelligent because you have the ultimate weapon against the big N.B.D. ― Nervous Break Down.
            Intelligent people do not have N.B.D.s because they are in charge of themselves. They know how to choose happiness over depression, because they know how to deal with the problems of their lives.
            You can begin to think of yourself as truly intelligent on the basis of how you choose to feel in the face of trying circumstances. The life struggles are pretty much the same for each of us. Everyone who is involved with other human beings in any social context has similar difficulties. Disagreements, conflicts and compromises are a part of what it means to be human. Similarly, money, growing old, sickness, deaths, natural disasters and accidents are all events which present problems to virtually all human beings. But some people are able to make it, to avoid immobilizing depression and unhappiness despite such occurrences, while others collapse or have an N.B.D. Those who recognize problems as a human condition and don’t measure happiness by an absence of problems are the most intelligent kind of humans we know; also, the most rare.



    36.
    	
    According to the author, the conventional notion of intelligence measured in terms of one’s ability to read, write and compute ________.
    A) is a widely accepted but wrong concept  
    B) will help erase intellectual prejudice  
    C) derives from all mental distress  
    D) will contribute to one’s self accomplishment  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    We can infer from the passage that holding a university degree ________.
    A) may result in one’s inability to solve complex real life problems  
    B) does not indicate one’s ability to write properly worded documents  
    C) may make one mentally sick and physically weak  
    D) does not mean that one is highly intelligent  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    The author thinks that an intelligent person knows ________.
    A) how to put up with some prevalent myths  
    B) how to find the best way to achieve success  
    C) how to obtain happiness and reject unhappiness  
    D) how to persuade others to compromise  

    正确答案： C
    39.
    	
    In the last paragraph, the author tells us that ________.
    A) difficulties are but a part of everyone’s life  
    B) difficulties in life are the root causes of depression and unhappiness  
    C) everybody should learn to avoid trying circumstances  
    D) good feelings can contribute to eventual academic excellence  

    正确答案： A
    40.
    	
    According to the passage, what kind of people are scarce?
    A) Those who don’t emphasize bookish excellence in their pursuit of happiness.  
    B) Those who are aware of difficulties in life but know how to avoid unhappiness.  
    C) Those who measure happiness by an absence of problems but seldom suffer from N.B.Ds.  
    D) Those who are able to secure happiness though having to struggle against trying circumstances.
