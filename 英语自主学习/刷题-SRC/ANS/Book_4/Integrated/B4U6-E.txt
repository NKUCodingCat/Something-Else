    Script:         The family is changing. In the past, grandparents, parents, and children used to live together, and they had an extended family. But family structure is changing throughout the world. The nuclear family consists of only one father, one mother, and children; it is becoming the main family structure everywhere.
            The nuclear family offers married women some advantages: they have freedom from their relatives, and the husband does not have all the power of the family. Studies show that in nuclear families, men and women usually make an equal number of decisions about family life.
            But wives usually have to “pay” for the benefits of freedom and power. When women lived in extended families, sisters, grandparents and aunts helped one another with housework and childcare. In addition, older women in a large family group had important positions. Wives in nuclear families do not often enjoy this benefit, and they have another disadvantage, too: women generally live longer than their husbands, so older women from nuclear families often have to live alone. Studies show that women are generally less satisfied with marriage than men are. In the past, men worked outside the home and women worked inside. Housework and childcare were a full time job, and there was no time for anything else. Now women work outside and have more freedom than they did in the past, but they still have to do most of the housework. The women actually have two full-time jobs, and they have not much free time.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Nowadays, more and more people are using e-mail to say a few nice words to each other. The result: a new culture of love-letter writing has evolved and is rewriting the rules in how we express our love.
            Make no mistake: in many cases the e-mail love letters significantly resemble their ancestor. The verbal imagery has hardly changed. Experts believe, in fact, that far more people now carry out sweet talk in cyberspace than in the time before e-mail came along. When people communicate over e-mail, everything is much more relaxed, less serious, and this helps the sweet words flow.
            Nicola Doering, a media researcher, emphasizes that for many people contact over e-mail is simpler: “The language is a different one here than in traditional letters; people tend to write more like they speak.” This means that an e-mail writer might not have to think over every word, as is often expected with traditional love letter. This is obviously encouraging for many people.
            But for longer, particularly romantic love letter, e-mail writers also reach back into the language of poetry, “Your calf-blue eyes” is typical for the kind of phrasings found in e-mail love letters. Moreover, at least one traditional symbol between lovers has made an outstanding comeback. Even in the love letters of the 19th century, one often found the letter X as a symbol of a kiss. Many paper love letters would have three X’s at the bottom as a closing. And this symbol is often used today between lovers in their e-mail messages.
            In spite of all the technological advancement that e-mail represents, classic love letters on paper still have a special meaning, the experts say. Ink on paper simply affects many people more strongly than lines on a computer screen. It appears more serious, more obligatory, as if written for all eternity. Sometimes people want to have something to touch, a letter that you can really hold in your hand.
            But Internet technology is ready to help even those with the courage to write a classic handwritten love letter. What stops many lovers from penning their most romantic thought is not a lack of good intention but an inability to piece together a few sweet lines, says Thomas Neuss, the organizer of one Internet site devoted to romantic letters.



    31.
    	
    The author strongly believes that ______.
    A) e-mail love letters are more significant than traditional ones  
    B) e-mail love letters are more convenient than traditional ones  
    C) most e-mail love letters copy sweet words from traditional ones  
    D) most e-mail love letters are quite similar to traditional ones  

    正确答案： D
    32.
    	
    According to Nicola Doering, the distinguishing advantage of e-mail love letters is ______.
    A) more spoken language can be used  
    B) more sweet words will be employed  
    C) it will bring more romance to lovers  
    D) the message will be shorter and simpler  

    正确答案： A
    33.

    A) many people like using letters to express their love  
    B) traditional symbol between lovers has been popular

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Our entire human existence is based on change. Our species is dependent upon the advancement of life and our culture. If we were to forever remain the same, without evolving, perhaps our collective existence wouldn’t even be possible. It remains within our individual powers to hold onto the past. We do not have to let technology take hold of us and our lives.
            Seven Birkerts, in his article “Into the Electronic Millennium”, seems to feel as if technology is corrupting, and will continue to corrupt, our culture. In specific, he focuses on literature and language as being the core of what is being corrupted. My question is, how can something be corrupted that is, in fact, already corrupted?
            Language wasn’t created as written expression. Words were invented as personal thoughts that were spoken orally, either to oneself or to an audience. Either way, listeners of words were limited by a storyteller’s own preferences. One could argue that the evolution of oral language into written language has been corrupted by these preferences. Today, language isn’t as personal and limited as in the past. In our era, the printed form of language has merely been converted to an electronic form by technology. Technology loses much of the personal touches that perhaps created language, and the population is now not really limited at all by a storyteller’s preferences, but perhaps this freedom is commendable. The entire world is now open to everything. We all have the opportunity to learn, read, and see whatever we desire.
            The freedom offered by technology shouldn’t be seen as “a destruction of tokens from the past”, as Birkerts seems to believe. It is merely the introduction of a future. The past is just that, the past; we can’t change it. Therefore, it will always be there. It is in a way indestructible. We, society, decide what is neglected in our past and in our culture. The addition of the television did not rid our society of books and outdoor activities as was believed by some. In similar fashion, the advent of the computer does not restrict us as a society to our homes, speaking to virtual others. Birkerts’ view that our society will create another group of hermits and loners simply won’t happen. Humans by nature are social beings. We thrive on the comfort and companionship of other humans. To rid ourselves of that would be too harmful. We will never close ourselves as a whole to others; the costs outweigh the benefits.



    36.
    	
    What does the sentence “It remains within our individual powers to hold onto the past” (Para. 1) mean?
    A) We can’t live in a society full of changes.  
    B) We could live in the past without evolving.  
    C) Human beings can live in the present fashion.  
    D) Human beings can’t live in the old fashion.  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    Nowadays, we have the opportunity to learn and read whatever we desire because _____.
    A) we are not as limited as before due to the advancement of technology  
    B) we have fewer chances to touch the storyteller’s viewpoints directly  
    C) language also develops with the advancement of technology  
    D) language isn’t influenced by the storyteller’s preferences  

    正确答案： A
    38.
