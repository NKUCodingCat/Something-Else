    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            After the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, structural engineers are trying hard to solve a question that a month ago would have been completely unthinkable: Can building be designed to withstand catastrophic blasts inflicted by terrorists?
            Ten days after the terrorist attacks on the twin towers, structural engineers from the University at Buffalo and the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER) headquartered at UB traveled to ground zero(被毁现场) as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation. “Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage,” said M. Bruneau, Ph. D. “Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks,” he added.
            Photographs taken by the investigators demonstrate in startling detail the monumental damage inflicted on the World Trade Center towers and buildings in the vicinity. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. “This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column there that used to be part of that building,” explained A. Whittaker, Ph. D. “The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor.”
            The visit to the area also revealed some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing system in one of the adjacent buildings was quite rugged, allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris to remain intact. “Highly redundant ductile framing systems may provide a simple, but robust strategy for blast resistance,” he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails.
            A. Reinhorn, Ph. D. noted that “Earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of many buildings in the past. It induces dynamic response and extremely high stresses and deformations in structural components. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may be directly applicable to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design. Part of our mission now at UB is to transfer these solutions and to develop new ones where none exist at present.”



    31.
    	
    The question raised in the first paragraph is one _________________.
    A) that was asked by structural engineers a month ago  
    B) that is too difficult for structural engineers to answer even now  
    C) that was never thought of before the terrorist attack  
    D) that terrorists are eager to find a solution to  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    The project funded by the National Science Foundation________________.
    A) was first proposed by some engineers at UB  
    B) took about two days to complete  
    C) was to investigate the damage caused by the terrorist attack  
    D) was to find out why some buildings could survive the blasts  

    正确答案： D
    33.
    	
    The column mentioned by Dr. Whittaker____________________.
    A) was part of the building close to the World Trade Center  
    B) was part of the World Trade Center  
    C) was shot through the window and the floor of the World Trade Center  
    D) damaged many buildings in the vicinity of the World Trade Center  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    A surprising discovery made by the investigators during their visit to ground zero is that ________.
    A) floors in the adjacent building remain undamaged  
    B) some floor framing systems demonstrate resistance to explosion  
    C) simple floor framing systems are more blast resistant  
    D) floors in one of the adjacent buildings were pierced by tons of debris  

    正确答案： B
    35.
    	
    What Dr. Reinhorn said in the last paragraph may imply all the following EXCEPT that ________.
    A) blast engineers should develop new solutions for terror-resistant design  
    B) blast engineering can borrow technologies developed for terror-resistant design  
    C) solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to terrorist-resistant design  
    D) blast engineering emerges as a new branch of science  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            In her international bestselling Talk to the Hand, author Lynne Truss argues that common courtesies such as saying “Excuse me” are practically extinct. There are certainly plenty who would agree with her.
            Is it really true? We decided to find out by experiments. In dozens of American cities, our reporters performed two experiments: “door tests” (Would anyone hold one open for them?) and “document drops” (Who would help them retrieve a pile of “accidentally” dropped papers?). Along the way, the reporters encountered all types：men and women of different races, ages，professions, and income levels.
            While 90 percent of the people passed the door test，only 55 percent passed the document drop. Are people less likely to help others when doing so takes extra effort or time? Not always, the reporters found. Take the pregnant woman who thought nothing of bending down to help us with our papers. Or the woman named Liz who balanced two coffees，her keys and her wallet on a takeout tray with one hand，while picking up papers off the wet pavement with the other. Her reason for helping? “I was there,” she said.
            Overall, men were the most willing to help, especially when it came to document drops. In those，men offered aid 63 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent among women. Of course, men weren’t entirely democratic about whom they’d help. All of them held the door for the female reporter, and were more than twice as likely to help her pick up fallen papers than they were to help our male reporter.
            By far, the most common reason people cited for being willing to go out of their way to help others was their upbringing. “It’s the way I was raised,” said one young woman who held a door open despite struggling with her umbrella on a rainy day in Brooklyn. We realize this isn’t a rigorous scientific study, but we believe it is a reasonable real-world test of good manners around the globe. And it’s comforting to know that in a place where millions of people push one another each day to get ahead, they’re able to do it with a smile. Hey, if they can make nice here，they can make nice anywhere.



    36.
    	
    Which of the following is the best word to describe the experiments?
    A) Scientific.  
    B) Biased.  
    C) Revolutionary.  
    D) Realistic.

    B) won’t take the trouble to help others  
    C) may help others save time  
    D) won’t help others save time  

    正确答案： A
    38.

    A) women are more careful  
    B) women are more likely to need help  
    C) men are more ready to help
