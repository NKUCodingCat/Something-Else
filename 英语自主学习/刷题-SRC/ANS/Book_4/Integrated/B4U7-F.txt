The two towers of the Center were the tallest buildings in the city. They had more than 100 levels. Then on the morning of September 11, two hijacked airplanes struck the buildings.
            Many people died immediately in explosions and fires. Others ran down countless steps in an effort to escape the buildings. Others waited for help in their offices. Then, one after another, both buildings fell. The collapse of the towers killed thousands of people. It also wrecked or damaged surrounding buildings.
            Engineers from the state of Illinois soon will investigate the collapse of the buildings for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Their early study, however, shows that the buildings held up well. One tower remained standing for about 47 minutes after the plane hit it. The other tower stayed up for about one hour and forty minutes after it was struck. The fact that the towers stayed up as long as they did permitted many people to escape.

So they loaded the planes heavily with fuel. The heat from the burning fuel weakened the steel structure of the towers. These fires burned far hotter than fires used to test building materials. They also burned longer. The intense heat caused the upper levels of the buildings to fall. Then the lower levels also fell.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            After the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, structural engineers are trying hard to solve a question that a month ago would have been completely unthinkable: Can building be designed to withstand catastrophic blasts inflicted by terrorists?
            Ten days after the terrorist attacks on the twin towers, structural engineers from the University at Buffalo and the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER) headquartered at UB traveled to ground zero(被毁现场) as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation. “Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage,” said M. Bruneau, Ph. D. “Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks,” he added.
            Photographs taken by the investigators demonstrate in startling detail the monumental damage inflicted on the World Trade Center towers and buildings in the vicinity. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. “This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column there that used to be part of that building,” explained A. Whittaker, Ph. D. “The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor.”
            The visit to the area also revealed some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing system in one of the adjacent buildings was quite rugged, allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris to remain intact. “Highly redundant ductile framing systems may provide a simple, but robust strategy for blast resistance,” he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails.
            A. Reinhorn, Ph. D. noted that “Earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of many buildings in the past. It induces dynamic response and extremely high stresses and deformations in structural components. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may be directly applicable to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design. Part of our mission now at UB is to transfer these solutions and to develop new ones where none exist at present.”



    31.
    	
    The question raised in the first paragraph is one _________________.
    A) that was asked by structural engineers a month ago  
    B) that is too difficult for structural engineers to answer even now  
    C) that was never thought of before the terrorist attack  
    D) that terrorists are eager to find a solution to  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    The project funded by the National Science Foundation________________.
    A) was first proposed by some engineers at UB  
    B) took about two days to complete  
    C) was to investigate the damage caused by the terrorist attack  
    D) was to find out why some buildings could survive the blasts  

    正确答案： D
    33.
    	
    The column mentioned by Dr. Whittaker____________________.
    A) was part of the building close to the World Trade Center  
    B) was part of the World Trade Center  
    C) was shot through the window and the floor of the World Trade Center  
    D) damaged many buildings in the vicinity of the World Trade Center  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    A surprising discovery made by the investigators during their visit to ground zero is that ________.
    A) floors in the adjacent building remain undamaged  
    B) some floor framing systems demonstrate resistance to explosion  
    C) simple floor framing systems are more blast resistant  
    D) floors in one of the adjacent buildings were pierced by tons of debris  

    正确答案： B
    35.
    	
    What Dr. Reinhorn said in the last paragraph may imply all the following EXCEPT that ________.
    A) blast engineers should develop new solutions for terror-resistant design  
    B) blast engineering can borrow technologies developed for terror-resistant design  
    C) solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to terrorist-resistant design  
    D) blast engineering emerges as a new branch of science  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Chinese Americans today have higher incomes than Americans in general and higher occupational status. The Chinese have risen to this position despite some of the harshest discrimination and violence faced by any immigrants to the United States in the history of this country. Long confined to a narrow range of occupations they succeeded in those occupations and then spread out into other areas in later years, when opportunities finally opened up for them. Today much of the Chinese prosperity is due to the simple fact that they work more and have more (usually better) education than others. Almost one out of five Chinese families has three or more income earners compared to one out of thirteen for Puerto Ricans (波多黎各人), one out of ten among American Indians, and one out of eight among Whites. When the Chinese advantages in working and educational are held constant, they have no advantage over other Americans. That is in a Chinese Family with a given number of people working and with a given amount of education by the head of the family, the income is not only about average for such families, and offer a little less than average.
            While Chinese Americans as a group are prosperous and well-educated Chinatowns are pockets of poverty, and illiteracy is much higher among the Chinese than among Americans in general. Those paradoxes are due to sharp internal differences. Descendants of the Chinese Americans who emigrated long ago from Toishan Province have maintained Chinese values and have added acculturation (文化适应) to American society with remarkable success. More recent Hong Kong Chinese are from more diverse cultural origins, and acquired western values and styles in Hong Kong, without having acquired the skills to proper and support those aspirations in the American economy. Foreign-born Chinese men in the United States are one-fourth lower incomes than native-born Chinese even though the foreign-born have been in the United States an average of seventeen years. While the older Hong Kong Chinese work tenaciously (顽强地) to sustain and advance themselves, the Hong Kong Chinese youths often react with resentment and antisocial behavior, including terrorism and murder. The need to maintain tourism in Chinatown causes the Chinese leaders to mute or downplay these problems as much as possible.



    36.
    	
    According to the passage, today, Chinese Americans owe their prosperity to______________.
    A) their diligence and better education than others  
    B) their support of American government  
    C) their fight against discriminations  
    D) advantages in working only  

    正确答案： A
    37.

    D) problems of Chinese Americans today  

    正确答案： C
    38.
    	
    Chinatowns are pockets of poverty, as is probably associated with ______________.
    A) most descendants of Chinese Americans are rebelling  
    B) most descendants of Chinese Americans are illiterate  
    C) sharp internal difference between Chinese coming from different cultural backgrounds  
    D) only a few Chinese Americans are rich  

    正确答案： C
    39.
