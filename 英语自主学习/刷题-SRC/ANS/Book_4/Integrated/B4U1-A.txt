    Script:         The Winter War was a military conflict between the Soviet Union and Finland. It began with a Soviet offensive on 30 November 1939 and ended on 13 March 1940 with the Moscow Peace Treaty. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the League on 14 December 1939.
            The Soviet forces had three times as many soldiers as the Finns, 30 times as many aircraft, and a hundred times as many tanks. The Red Army, however, had been crippled by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin’s Great Purge of 1937, reducing the army’s morale and efficiency shortly before the outbreak of the fighting. With more than 30,000 of its army officers executed or imprisoned, including most of those of the highest ranks, the Red Army in 1939 had many inexperienced senior officers. Because of these factors, and high commitment and morale in the Finnish forces, Finland was able to resist the Soviet invasion for far longer than the Soviets expected.

The Soviet forces did not accomplish their objective of the total conquest of Finland, but did gain sufficient territory along Lake Ladoga to provide a buffer for Leningrad.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Terrorism may be viewed as the use of force or violence against persons or property to threaten or coerce (迫使) a government, a formal organization, or a civilian population for political, religious, or social objectives. Since terrorists commonly use violence against civilian targets, their actions are widely condemned as morally unacceptable. In practice, as with a great many other behaviors, what constitutes terrorism is a matter of social definition. When nations resort to violence to further their interests, the results are considered as being legal warfare. In many respects, terrorism is an extension of that approach by people who lack the armies of a state.
            For many years the public, government officials, and scholars treated terrorism primarily as a "nuisance." But recently, we have come to see terrorism as a new mode of warfare with far-reaching implications. Terrorism serves as an avenue of political expression for some militants (好战分子), whether they are motivated by ideology, ethnicity, or religion. However, what distinguishes much contemporary terrorism is not so much its motivation or purpose, but rather the extent of state involvement in carrying out well-planned and highly destructive acts against adversary nations.
            Another feature of contemporary terrorism has been the extent to which it has become a media event. Terrorism is usually aimed at a media audience, not the actual victims. The act of media coverage also enhances the importance of "the problem" that led to the terrorist activities. Newspaper readers and television viewers see "the problem" as of much greater importance and as justifying national or international action.



    31.
    	
    According to the passage, terrorism is widely unacceptable ______.
    A) for its illegal actions  
    B) because it is often targeted at ordinary people

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            As traditionally grown, under a canopy (株冠) of shade trees and amid other vegetation, coffee is an environmentally-friendly crop. The shade trees fix nitrogen in the soil, fostering the growth of the coffee bushes, and their fallen leaves provide nutrients, further reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. The mixture of vegetation prevents erosion and protects the coffee from harsh weather. In contrast to corn and cattle, which almost always require clear-cutting, coffee can be grown in relative harmony with the rain forest.
            Recently, however, many coffee farmers in northern Latin America have reduced or eliminated shade to grow new high-yielding coffee plants under direct sun. Fear of a disease known as coffee leaf rust sparked an early round of conversions, most of which took place in the 1970s. To prevent the spread of the disease, coffee farmers "technified," replacing older, shade-loving coffee varieties, with new varieties, packed in tight hedgerows, that can survive open sun ― but only with chemical inputs.
            Coffee leaf rust never turned out to be a major problem for Latin America. To boost farmers' incomes, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) spent some $80 million from the 1970s to the early 1990s, according to a report (1996) from the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center and the Natural Resources Defense Council, to help growers in Central America and the Caribbean technify. In countries where USAID was not involved, national coffee federations promoted the change, supporting the technification of 69 percent of Colombia's coffee and nearly 40 percent of Costa Rica's.



    36.

    38.

    A) out of the fear of the spread of coffee leaf rust
