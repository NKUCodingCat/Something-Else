    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 25 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            On an eight-mile stretch of Interstate 15 ten miles north of San Diego, traffic engineers are   21    an MIT-designed system which will introduce the “automated driver.” The plan calls for computers, aided by thousands of three-inch   22    spikes buried in the highway, to take complete control of the driving of cars on heavily trafficked roads. Cars will be   23    into groups of ten to twelve vehicles, only six feet   24    , traveling in unison, and controlled by computer.
       25    of this computerized highway have great hopes for its future. By 2010, telematics may well be   26    one of the major highways in the United States. If successful, by 2020, as the price of   27    drops to below a penny a piece, telematics could be adopted in thousands of miles of highways in the United States. This could prove to be an   28    boon as well, saving fuel, reducing   29    , decreasing air pollution, and serving as an   30    to highway expansion.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            You slip the key into the ignition and crank the engine to life. But before you put the car into gear, you tap a key on the keyboard mounted by the steering wheel, and your newest e-mail flashes up on the windscreen.
            This seductive satyr is what you get when you cross a car and a computer. Dubbed the “network vehicle”, or net-mobile, it may soon come to a driveway near you (probably the one belonging to your rich neighbor). In a net-mobile, a motorist could tap into a regional road system but also to map out a route around rush-hour traffic snags. Drivers and passengers will be able to send and receive e-mail, track the latest sports scores or stock quotes, surf the Web, and even play video games. Or so, at least, say a number of computer-industry firms such as Microsoft, Sun, IBM and Netscape.
            The modern car is already an electronic showcase on wheels. On-board microcomputers improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. They operate anti-lock brake systems, and on some cars even regulate the firmness of the shock absorbers. But much of the technology needed to add extra is available now. A prototype network vehicle, produced by a consortium of Netscape, Sun, IBM and Delco (an automotive electronics firm based in Michigan), was introduced at the recent annual computer industry show in Las Vegas.
            It not only offered such desktop-computer-like services as e-mail, but allowed a driver to use them without looking away from the road. It was operated by voice commands and projected its data on to the windscreen, using the same sort of head-up display system found in modern fighter jets. Members of the consortium think a real-world network vehicle could be in production in as little as four years.
            Car-makers have already begun rolling out some of the features found on these prototype net mobiles. If the driver of a General Motors car equipped with its On-Star system locks his key in the car, for example, an emergency centre can transmit a digital signal to unlock the doors. On-star also calls automatically for help if an accident triggers the airbags. Toyota and General Motors are among a growing list of firms offering such in-car navigation systems. And in Europe, BMW and Mercedes-Benz recently introduced navigation hardware that can not only plot out a route, but alert a driver to traffic jams.



    31.

    A) sends and receives e-mails, and surfs the Web

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            According to some individuals, if your house is built in the right position, this may affect your success in life, which seems strange to many people. However, to believers in Feng-Shui, or the art of geomancy, not only the position but also the choice of decorations and even the color of your home can mean the difference between good fortune and disaster. This art has been practiced for centuries in China and is still used all over South East Asia. Even the huge Hong Kong banks call in a geomant if they are planning to build new offices.
            Like many Oriental beliefs the geomant’s skill depends on the idea of harmony in nature. If there is no imbalance between the opposing forces of Yin and Yang, the building will bring luck to its inhabitants. This means that the house must be built on the right spot as well as facing the right direction, and also be painted an auspicious color. For instance, if there are mountains to the north, this will protect them from evil influences. If the house is painted red, this will bring happiness to the occupants while green symbolizes youth and will bring long life. The geomant believes that unless all these are considered when choosing a site for construction, the fortune of the people using it will be at risk.
            Indeed, to ignore the geomant’s advice can have fatal results. The death of the internationally famous Kung-Fu star, Bruce Lee, has been used as an example. It is said that when Lee found out that the house he was living in was an unlucky one, he followed a geomant’s advice and installed an eight-sided mirror outside his front door to bring him luck. Unfortunately, a storm damaged the mirror and the house was left unprotected from harmful influences. Soon afterwards Lee died in mysterious circumstances. 　　
            Not only is Feng-Shui still used in South East Asia, but it has also spread right across the world. Even in modern New York a successful commercial artist called Milton Glaser has found it useful. He was so desperate after his office was broken into six times that he consulted a geomant. He was told to install a fish tank with six black fish and fix a red clock to the ceiling. Since then he has not been burglarized once. It may seem an incredible story, but no other suitable explanation has been offered.



    36.
    	
    From the passage we can infer that Feng-Shui is NOT used in ______.
    A) Japan  
    B) New York  
    C) Hong Kong  
    D) China  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    Geomants believe that ______.
    A) houses must only be painted red  
    B) houses must face mountains  
    C) nature and life should be in harmony  
    D) green is an unlucky color  

    正确答案： C
    38.
    	
    Geomants think that the reason for Bruce Lee’s death is that ______.
    A) he didn’t follow the geomants’ advice  
    B) he installed an eight-sided mirror  
    C) he misunderstood the geomant’s advice  
    D) a storm damaged the protection for his house  

    正确答案： D
    39.

    A) colors are not important in geomancy  
    B) geomancy is used in the West
