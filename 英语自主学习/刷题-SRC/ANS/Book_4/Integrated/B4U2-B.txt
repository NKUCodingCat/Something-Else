    Section B 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.


            Some pessimistic experts feel that the automobile is bound to fall into disuse. They see a day in the not-too-distant future when all autos will be (11)_________________ and allowed to rust. Other authorities, however, think the auto is here to stay. They hold that the car will remain a (12)_________________ means of urban travel in the foreseeable future.

    Script:         Some pessimistic experts feel that the automobile is bound to fall into disuse. They see a day in the not-too-distant future when all autos will be abandoned and allowed to rust. Other authorities, however, think the auto is here to stay. They hold that the car will remain a leading means of urban travel in the foreseeable future.
            The motorcar will undoubtedly change significantly over the next 30 years. It should become smaller, safer, and more economical, and should not be powered by the gasoline engine. The car of the future should be far more pollution-free than present types. Regardless of its power source, the auto in the future will still be the main problem in urban traffic jams. One proposed solution to this problem is the automated highway system.
            When the auto enters the highway system, a retractable (可伸缩的) arm will drop from the auto and make contact with a rail. It is quite similar to those powering subway trains electrically. Once attached to the rail, the car will become electrically powered from the system, and control of the vehicle will pass to a central computer. The computer will then monitor all of the car’s movements. The driver will use a telephone to dial instructions about his destination into the system. The computer will calculate the best route, and reserve space for the car all the way to the correct exit from the highway. The driver will then be free to relax and wait for the buzzer that will warn him of his coming exit.

    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 25 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            On an eight-mile stretch of Interstate 15 ten miles north of San Diego, traffic engineers are   21    an MIT-designed system which will introduce the “automated driver.” The plan calls for computers, aided by thousands of three-inch   22    spikes buried in the highway, to take complete control of the driving of cars on heavily trafficked roads. Cars will be   23    into groups of ten to twelve vehicles, only six feet   24    , traveling in unison, and controlled by computer.
       25    of this computerized highway have great hopes for its future. By 2010, telematics may well be   26    one of the major highways in the United States. If successful, by 2020, as the price of   27    drops to below a penny a piece, telematics could be adopted in thousands of miles of highways in the United States. This could prove to be an   28    boon as well, saving fuel, reducing   29    , decreasing air pollution, and serving as an   30    to highway expansion.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            You slip the key into the ignition and crank the engine to life. But before you put the car into gear, you tap a key on the keyboard mounted by the steering wheel, and your newest e-mail flashes up on the windscreen.
            This seductive satyr is what you get when you cross a car and a computer. Dubbed the “network vehicle”, or net-mobile, it may soon come to a driveway near you (probably the one belonging to your rich neighbor). In a net-mobile, a motorist could tap into a regional road system but also to map out a route around rush-hour traffic snags. Drivers and passengers will be able to send and receive e-mail, track the latest sports scores or stock quotes, surf the Web, and even play video games. Or so, at least, say a number of computer-industry firms such as Microsoft, Sun, IBM and Netscape.
            The modern car is already an electronic showcase on wheels. On-board microcomputers improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. They operate anti-lock brake systems, and on some cars even regulate the firmness of the shock absorbers. But much of the technology needed to add extra is available now. A prototype network vehicle, produced by a consortium of Netscape, Sun, IBM and Delco (an automotive electronics firm based in Michigan), was introduced at the recent annual computer industry show in Las Vegas.
            It not only offered such desktop-computer-like services as e-mail, but allowed a driver to use them without looking away from the road. It was operated by voice commands and projected its data on to the windscreen, using the same sort of head-up display system found in modern fighter jets. Members of the consortium think a real-world network vehicle could be in production in as little as four years.
            Car-makers have already begun rolling out some of the features found on these prototype net mobiles. If the driver of a General Motors car equipped with its On-Star system locks his key in the car, for example, an emergency centre can transmit a digital signal to unlock the doors. On-star also calls automatically for help if an accident triggers the airbags. Toyota and General Motors are among a growing list of firms offering such in-car navigation systems. And in Europe, BMW and Mercedes-Benz recently introduced navigation hardware that can not only plot out a route, but alert a driver to traffic jams.



    31.

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            The Super Bowl is one of the biggest events on the advertising calendar. The battle for the National Football League’s ultimate prize attracts more viewers than anything else on American television and provides a “symbolic pulsetaking” for the advertising industry every February, says John Frelinghuysen, an analyst at Bain and Company, a consultancy. But this year the patient is in poor health. All the advertising slots (广告摊位) for the 2008 Super Bowl had been sold by the end of November 2007, despite the $ 2.6 million price of each. For 2009 the price has risen to $ 3 million, but at least, ten slots (out of 67) are still looking for a buyer.
            General Motors, which ran 11 ads on Super Bowl Sunday in February 2008, has already said that it will not run any in 2009. America’s two other big carmakers, Ford and Chrysler, are likely to follow suit. Tellingly, Monster com, an online job-search company, said recently that it was buying a slot. To some extent, 2009’s Super Bowl will reflect a country in recession and indicate a hard year for the advertising industry.
            Most forecasts for next year say that ad spending in America will decline by 5% or more. Much depends on the fate of the automotive industry: carmakers and dealers normally spend around $ 20 billion a year on advertising, but Chrysler and Ford scaled back their expenditure by more than 30% in the first nine months of 2008, and are expected to make further cuts in 2009 as they struggle for survival.
            The car industry’s situation will hurt all media, but especially television. Analysts at BMO Capital Markets predict that total spending on television ads will fall by almost 9% next year. Only newspapers, where a decline of 12% is expected, are forecast to fare worse. Carmakers have already shifted some of their advertising spending to the Internet, and are likely to go further in 2009. Car ads make up 25% of advertising revenues for local television channels, and carmakers have been among the most consistent buyers of high-priced ads on national television.
            So far local stations have been most affected by falling spending on advertising. National stations have been safer, because they operate on longer-term contracts with advertisers. But in the New Year they will also feel the chill, as companies fail to renew their contracts. Television, which has remained strong as print media have lost advertising dollars and readers to the Internet, could enter a decline of its own. “Next on the list is TV stations,” says Anthony Diclemente, a media analyst at Barclays Capital.



    36.
    	
    Why does the author give the example of Super Bowl?
    A) Because it is the most popular football games in America.  
    B) Because it shows advertisers’ enthusiasm in running slots has dropped.  
    C) Because it is an event that attracts the attention of advertisers.  
    D) Because it will be right on in America in 2009.  

    正确答案： B
    37.
    	
    Why can’t at least ten slots find a buyer (Last sentence, Para. 1) according to the passage?
    A) The price for running the advertising slots has risen to $ 3 million.  
    B) It is not attractive any more for the advertising industry.  
    C) The advertising slots have been on the rise since 2007.  
    D) The advertising industry is suffering a hard year.  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    What may the carmakers resort to for promoting their automobiles and cutting down expenditure?
    A) Shifting their advertising spending to the Internet.  
    B) Renewing new contracts with national stations.  
    C) Buying low-priced ads on national television.  
    D) Relying on such print media as newspaper.  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    What does the sentence “Next on the list is TV stations” ( last paragraph) said by Anthony Diclemente mean?
    A) What he is going to analyze next is TV stations.  
    B) What advertisers prefer to use is TV stations.  
    C) TV station is the next to be defeated by Internet.  
    D) He would choose TV station as a second choice.  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    We can learn from the passage that __________________.
    A) Ford and Chrysler will run the advertising slots in 2009  
    B) 2009’s Super Bowl will still be an expensive ads parade  
    C) America’s ad spending this year will decline by 5% or more  
    D) carmakers’ fate determines to certain extent the ad spending in America
