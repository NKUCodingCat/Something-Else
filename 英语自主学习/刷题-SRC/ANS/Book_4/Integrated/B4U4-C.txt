    Script:         This current wave of globalization has been driven by policies that have opened economies domestically and internationally. In the years since the Second World War, and especially during the past two decades, many governments have adopted free-market economic systems, vastly increasing their own productive potential and creating myriad new opportunities for international trade and investment. Governments also have negotiated dramatic reductions in barriers to commerce and have established international agreements to promote trade in goods, services, and investment. Taking advantage of new opportunities in foreign markets, corporations have built foreign factories and established production and marketing arrangements with foreign partners. Globalization is deeply controversial, however. Proponents of globalization argue that it allows poor countries and their citizens to develop economically and raise their standards of living, while opponents of globalization claim that the creation of an unfettered international free market has benefited multinational corporations in the Western world at the expense of local enterprises, local cultures, and common people. Resistance to globalization has therefore taken shape both at a popular and at a governmental level as people and governments try to manage the flow of capital, labor, goods, and ideas that constitute the current wave of globalization. To find the right balance between benefits and costs associated with globalization, citizens of all nations need to understand how globalization works and the policy choices facing them and their societies.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become complicated. Many of life's problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people today.
            In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War Ⅱ. As families move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be consciously learned.
            Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now has more information available than any other generation, and the task of finding that one piece of information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated, time-consuming and sometimes even overwhelming.
            Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information. Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared worldwide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making more information available to more people.
            In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance. Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems, the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed. "Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most critical requirement of all people.



    31.
    	
    The word "it" (Para. 2) most probably refers to _______.
    A) the lack of stable communities  
    B) the breakdown of informal information channels  
    C) the increased mobility of families  
    D) the growing number of people moving from place to place  

    正确答案： B
    32.
    	
    The main problem people may encounter today arises from the fact that _______.
    A) they have to learn new things consciously  
    B) they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy information  
    C) they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily  
    D) they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended family  

    正确答案： C
    33.
    	
    From the passage we can infer that _______.
    A) electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting messages  
    B) it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an information era  
    C) people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences  
    D) events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites

    B) people should make the best use of the information  
    C) we should realize the importance of accumulating information  
    D) it is of vital importance to acquire needed information efficiently  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            In many ways, today’s business environment has changed qualitatively since the late 1980s. The end of the Cold War radically altered the very nature of the world’s politics and economics. In just a few short years, globalization has started a variety of trends with profound consequences: the opening of markets, true global competition, widespread deregulation (解除政府对……的控制) of industry, and an abundance of accessible capital. We have experienced both the benefits and risks of a truly global economy, with both Wall Street and Main Street (平民百姓) feeling the pains of economic disorder half a world away.
            At the same time, we have fully entered the Information Age, startling breakthroughs in information technology have irreversibly altered the ability to conduct business unconstrained by the traditional limitations of time or space. Today, it’s almost impossible to imagine a world without intranets, e-mail, and portable computers. With stunning speed, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we work, shop, do business, and communicate.
            As a consequence, we have truly entered the Post-Industrial economy. We are rapidly shifting from an economy based on manufacturing and commodities to one that places the greatest value on information, services, support, and distribution. That shift, in turn, place an unprecedented premium on “knowledge workers,” a new class of wealthy, educated, and mobile people who view themselves as free agents in a seller’s market.
            Beyond the realm of information technology, the accelerated pace of technological change in virtually every industry has created entirely new business, wiped out others, and produced a Pervasive (广泛的) demand for continuous innovation. New product, process, and distribution technologies provide powerful levers for creating competitive value. More companies are learning the importance of destructive technologies ― innovations that hold the potential to make a product line, or even an entire business segment, virtually outdated.
            Another major trend has been the fragmentation of consumer and business markets. There’s a growing appreciation that superficially similar groups of customers may have very different preferences in terms of what they want to buy and how they want to buy it. Now, new technology makes it easier, faster, and cheaper to identify and serve targeted micro-markets in ways that were physically impossible or prohibitively expensive in the past. Moreover, the trend feeds on itself, a business’s ability to serve sub-markets fuels customers’ appetites for more and more specialized offerings.



    36.
    	
    According to the first paragraph, the changes in the business environment in the past decades can be attributed to ________.
    A) technological advances  
    B) worldwide economic disorder  
    C) the fierce competition in industry  
    D) the globalization of economy  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    What idea does the author want to convey in the second paragraph?
    A) The rapid development of information technology has taken businessmen by surprise.  
    B) Information technology has removed the restrictions of time and space in business transactions.  
    C) The Internet, intranets, e-mail, and portable computers have penetrated every corner of the world.  
    D) The way we do business today has brought about startling breakthroughs in information technology.  

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    If a business wants to thrive in the Post-Industrial economy, ________.
    A) it has to invest more capital in the training of free agents to operate in a seller’s market  
    B) it should try its best to satisfy the increasing demands of mobile knowledgeable people  
    C) it should not overlook the importance of information, services, support, and distribution  
    D) it has to provide each of its employees with the latest information about the changing market  

    正确答案： C
    39.

    A) can eliminate an entire business segment  
    B) demand a radical change in providing services  
    C) may destroy the potential of a company to make any profit  
    D) call for continuous improvement in ways of doing business  

    正确答案： A
    40.
    	
    With the fragmentation of consumer and business markets ________.
    A) an increasing number of companies have disintegrated  
    B) manufacturers must focus on one special product to remain competitive in the market  
    C) it is physically impossible and prohibitively expensive to do business in the old way  
    D) businesses have to meet individual customers’ specific needs in order to succeed  

    正确答案： D
