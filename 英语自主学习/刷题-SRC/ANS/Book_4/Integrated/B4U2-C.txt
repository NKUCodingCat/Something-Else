    Script:         Some pessimistic experts feel that the automobile is bound to fall into disuse. They see a day in the not-too-distant future when all autos will be abandoned and allowed to rust. Other authorities, however, think the auto is here to stay. They hold that the car will remain a leading means of urban travel in the foreseeable future.
            The motorcar will undoubtedly change significantly over the next 30 years. It should become smaller, safer, and more economical, and should not be powered by the gasoline engine. The car of the future should be far more pollution-free than present types. Regardless of its power source, the auto in the future will still be the main problem in urban traffic jams. One proposed solution to this problem is the automated highway system.
            When the auto enters the highway system, a retractable (可伸缩的) arm will drop from the auto and make contact with a rail. It is quite similar to those powering subway trains electrically. Once attached to the rail, the car will become electrically powered from the system, and control of the vehicle will pass to a central computer. The computer will then monitor all of the car’s movements. The driver will use a telephone to dial instructions about his destination into the system. The computer will calculate the best route, and reserve space for the car all the way to the correct exit from the highway. The driver will then be free to relax and wait for the buzzer that will warn him of his coming exit.

Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            The car, and the roads it travels on, will be   21    in the twenty-first century. The key to tomorrow’s “smart cars” will be   22    . “We’ll see vehicles and roads that see and hear and feel and   23    and talk and act,” predicts Bill Spreitzer, technical director of General Motors Corporation's ITS program, which is designing the smart car and road of the future.
       24    40,000 people are killed each year in the United States in traffic accidents. The number of people that are killed or badly injured in car accidents is so   25    that we don’t even bother to   26    them in the newspapers anymore. Fully half of these fatalities come from drunk drivers, and many others from   27    . A smart car could eliminate most of these car accidents. It can sense if a driver is drunk   28    electronic sensors that can pick up alcohol vapor in the air, and refuse to   29    the engine. The car could also alert the police and provide its precise   30    if it is stolen.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Speeding off in a stolen car, the thief thinks he has got a great catch. But he is in for an unwelcome surprise. The car is fitted with a remote immobilizer (锁止器), and a radio signal from a control centre miles away will ensure that once the thief switches the engine off, he will not be able to start it again.
            For now, such devices are only available for fleets of trucks and specialist vehicles used on construction sites. But remote immobilization technology could soon start to trickle down to ordinary cars, and should be available in the UK in two months.
            The idea goes like this. A control box fitted to the car contains a mini-cellphone, a micro-processor and memory, and a GPS satellite positioning receiver. If the car is stolen, a coded cellphone signal will tell the control centre to block the vehicle’s engine management system and prevent the engine being restarted.
            In the UK, a set of technical fixes is already making life harder for car thieves. “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed,” says Martyn Randall, a security expert. He says it would only take him a few minutes to teach a person how to steal a car, using a bare minimum of tools. But only if the car is more than 10 years old.
            Modern cars are far tougher to steal, as their engine management computer won’t allow them to start unless they receive a unique ID code beamed out by the ignition (点火) key. In the UK, technologies like this have helped achieve a 31% drop in vehicle-related crime since 1997.
            But determined criminals are still managing to find other ways to steal cars, often by getting bold of the owner’s keys. And key theft is responsible for 40% of the thefts of vehicles fitted with a tracking system.
            If the car travels 100 meters without the driver confirming their ID, the system will send a signal to an operations centre that it has been stolen. The hundred meters minimum avoids false alarms due to inaccuracies in the GPS signal.
            Staff at the centre will then contact the owner to confirm that the car really is missing, and keep police informed of the vehicle’s movements via the car’s GPS unit.



    31.
    	
    What’s the function of the remote immobilizer fitted to a car?
    A) To help the police make a surprise attack on the car thief.  
    B) To allow the car to lock automatically when stolen.  
    C) To prevent the car thief from restarting it once it stops.  
    D) To prevent car theft by sending a radio signal to the car owner.  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    By saying “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed” (Lines 1-2. Para. 4), Martyn Randall suggests that ________.
    A) it takes a longer time for the car thief to do the stealing  
    B) self-prepared tools are no longer enough for car theft  
    C) the thief has to make use of computer technology  
    D) the thief has lost interest in stealing cars over 10 years old  

    正确答案： B
    33.
    	
    _______________ is essential in making a modem car tougher to steal.
    A) A coded ignition key  
    B) A unique ID card  
    C) A special cellphone signal  
    D) A GPS satellite positioning receiver  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    Why does the tracking system set a 100-metre minimum before sending an alarm to the operations centre?
    A) To leave time for the operations centre to give an alarm.  
    B) To keep police informed of the car’s movements.  
    C) To give the driver time to contact the operations centre.  
    D) To allow for possible errors in the GPS system.  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    What will the operations centre do first after receiving an alarm?
    A) Start the tracking system.  
    B) Contact the car owner.  
    C) Block the car engine.  
    D) Locate the missing car.  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            You slip the key into the ignition and crank the engine to life. But before you put the car into gear, you tap a key on the keyboard mounted by the steering wheel, and your newest e-mail flashes up on the windscreen.
            This seductive satyr is what you get when you cross a car and a computer. Dubbed the “network vehicle”, or net-mobile, it may soon come to a driveway near you (probably the one belonging to your rich neighbor). In a net-mobile, a motorist could tap into a regional road system but also to map out a route around rush-hour traffic snags. Drivers and passengers will be able to send and receive e-mail, track the latest sports scores or stock quotes, surf the Web, and even play video games. Or so, at least, say a number of computer-industry firms such as Microsoft, Sun, IBM and Netscape.
            The modern car is already an electronic showcase on wheels. On-board microcomputers improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. They operate anti-lock brake systems, and on some cars even regulate the firmness of the shock absorbers. But much of the technology needed to add extra is available now. A prototype network vehicle, produced by a consortium of Netscape, Sun, IBM and Delco (an automotive electronics firm based in Michigan), was introduced at the recent annual computer industry show in Las Vegas.
            It not only offered such desktop-computer-like services as e-mail, but allowed a driver to use them without looking away from the road. It was operated by voice commands and projected its data on to the windscreen, using the same sort of head-up display system found in modern fighter jets. Members of the consortium think a real-world network vehicle could be in production in as little as four years.
            Car-makers have already begun rolling out some of the features found on these prototype net mobiles. If the driver of a General Motors car equipped with its On-Star system locks his key in the car, for example, an emergency centre can transmit a digital signal to unlock the doors. On-star also calls automatically for help if an accident triggers the airbags. Toyota and General Motors are among a growing list of firms offering such in-car navigation systems. And in Europe, BMW and Mercedes-Benz recently introduced navigation hardware that can not only plot out a route, but alert a driver to traffic jams.
