    Script:         In America, people are faced with more and more decisions every day, whether it’s picking one of thirty-one ice cream flavors or deciding whether and when to get married. That sounds like a great thing, but as a recent study has shown, too many choices can make us confused, unhappy, even paralyzed with indecision. “That’s particularly true when it comes to the work place”, says Barry Schwartz, an author of six books about human behavior. Students are graduating with a variety of skills and interests, but often find themselves overwhelmed when it comes to choosing an ultimate career goal. In a study, Schwartz observed decision-making among college students during their senior year. Based on answers to questions regarding their job hunting strategies and career decisions, he divided the students into two groups: maximizers, who consider every possible option, and satisfiers, who look until they find an option that is good enough. You might expect that the student who had undertaken the most exhausted search would be the most satisfied with their final decision, but it turns out that’s not true. Schwartz found that while maximizers ended up with better-paying jobs than satisfiers on average, they weren’t as happy with their decision. The reason why these people feel less satisfied is that a world of possibilities may also be a world of missed opportunities. When you look at every possible option, you tend to focus more on what was given up than what was gained. After surveying every option, a person is more acutely aware of the opportunities they had to turn down to pursue just one career.

            My mentor, Curt Carlson, is the   21    man in Minnesota, owner of a hotel and travel company with sales   22    $9 billion. I had to get to a meeting in New York one day, and Curt   23    offered me a ride in his jet. It happened to be a day Minnesota was hit with one of the worst snowstorms in years. Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport was closed for the first time in   24    .
            Then, though the storm continued to   25    us, the airport opened a runway for small craft only. As we were taxiing down it to   26    , Curt turned to me and said gleefully, “Look, Harvey, no tracks in the snow!”

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Job sharing refers to the situation in which two people divide the responsibility of one full-time job. The two people willingly act as part-time workers, enough hours between them to fulfill the duties of a full-time worker. If they each work half the job, for example, they each receive 50 percent of the job’s wages, its holidays and its other benefits. Of course, some job sharers take a smaller or larger share of the responsibilities of the position, receiving a lesser or greater share of the benefits.
            Job sharing differs from conventional part-time work in that it occurs mainly in the more highly skilled and professional areas, which require higher levels of responsibility and employee commitment. Job sharing should not be confused with the term work sharing, which refers to increasing the number of jobs by reducing the number of hours of each existing job, thus offering more positions to the growing number of unemployed people. Job sharing, by contrast, is not designed to address unemployment problems; its focus, rather, is to provide well-paid work for skilled workers and professionals who want more free time for other activities.
            As would be expected, women constitute the bulk of job sharers. A survey carded out in 1988 by Britain’s Equal Opportunities Commission revealed that 78 per cent of sharers were female, the majority of whom were between 20 and 40 years of age. Subsequent studies have come up with similar results. Many of these women were re-entering the job market after having had children, but they chose not to seek part-time work because it would have meant lower status.
            Job sharing also offered an acceptable shift back into full-time work after a long absence. The necessity of close cooperation when sharing a job with another person makes the actual work quite different from conventional one-position jobs. However, to ensure a greater chance that the partnership will succeed, each person needs to know the strengths, weaknesses and preferences of his or her partner before applying for a position. Moreover, there must be a fair division of both routine tasks and interesting ones. In sum, for a position to be job-shared well, the two individuals must be well matched and must treat each other as equals.

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Careers for women should not be any different from careers for men. Decisions about gainful and satisfying employment for women should be made on the basis of individual interest and abilities. A variety of factors can help women find better jobs. Women need better career planning and counseling. They should be encouraged to develop personal goals that will enable them to compete for good jobs in light of their abilities, desires and training. Career guidance should begin at the junior high school level, or even at the elementary school level, with the assistance of counselors, teachers and parents. Some women must change their career aspirations. Since openings in the usual women’s occupations will not be sufficient to supply jobs for all women seeking work, they must choose alternatives in other occupations. Many of these jobs may pay higher wages and offer greater opportunities for promotion. In the past, too many women were forced to settle for second best. Others were willing to settle for inferior jobs because they felt that their stay in the labor force would be temporary. However, the situation is changing as more and more women become aware of the possibility of combining the roles of wife, mother, and homemaker with that of paid worker. Employer’s attitudes about women’s roles and desires to work need to be changed. Perhaps, the overriding factors and the myths that employers, policymakers, and others in our society have unfairly associated with the work patterns of women. One such myth is that women are not seriously attached to the labor force, as they work only for pocket money. However, one recent study shows that of the 33 million women in the labor force, more than half are working because of pressing economic needs. These women comprise a group who are either single, widowed, divorced, separated, or married to men with incomes of less than $ 5,000 a year. Women constitute nearly two fifths of the work force. However, because of foregone conclusions about their interests and abilities, women are unfairly restricted in the kinds of jobs they hold. Their concentration in the less rewarding, lower paying occupations with fewer chances for advancement. Personal choice in the world of work will begin to become a reality when the guidance counselor, the shop teacher, the plant employer, and women themselves are able to develop an appreciation for the differences in personal abilities and desires.
