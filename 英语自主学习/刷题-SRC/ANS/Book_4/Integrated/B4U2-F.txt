    Script:         Some pessimistic experts feel that the automobile is bound to fall into disuse. They see a day in the not-too-distant future when all autos will be abandoned and allowed to rust. Other authorities, however, think the auto is here to stay. They hold that the car will remain a leading means of urban travel in the foreseeable future.
            The motorcar will undoubtedly change significantly over the next 30 years. It should become smaller, safer, and more economical, and should not be powered by the gasoline engine. The car of the future should be far more pollution-free than present types. Regardless of its power source, the auto in the future will still be the main problem in urban traffic jams. One proposed solution to this problem is the automated highway system.
            When the auto enters the highway system, a retractable (可伸缩的) arm will drop from the auto and make contact with a rail. It is quite similar to those powering subway trains electrically. Once attached to the rail, the car will become electrically powered from the system, and control of the vehicle will pass to a central computer. The computer will then monitor all of the car’s movements. The driver will use a telephone to dial instructions about his destination into the system. The computer will calculate the best route, and reserve space for the car all the way to the correct exit from the highway. The driver will then be free to relax and wait for the buzzer that will warn him of his coming exit.

            The car, and the roads it travels on, will be   21    in the twenty-first century. The key to tomorrow’s “smart cars” will be   22    . “We’ll see vehicles and roads that see and hear and feel and   23    and talk and act,” predicts Bill Spreitzer, technical director of General Motors Corporation's ITS program, which is designing the smart car and road of the future.
       24    40,000 people are killed each year in the United States in traffic accidents. The number of people that are killed or badly injured in car accidents is so   25    that we don’t even bother to   26    them in the newspapers anymore. Fully half of these fatalities come from drunk drivers, and many others from   27    . A smart car could eliminate most of these car accidents. It can sense if a driver is drunk   28    electronic sensors that can pick up alcohol vapor in the air, and refuse to   29    the engine. The car could also alert the police and provide its precise   30    if it is stolen.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            The Super Bowl is one of the biggest events on the advertising calendar. The battle for the National Football League’s ultimate prize attracts more viewers than anything else on American television and provides a “symbolic pulsetaking” for the advertising industry every February, says John Frelinghuysen, an analyst at Bain and Company, a consultancy. But this year the patient is in poor health. All the advertising slots (广告摊位) for the 2008 Super Bowl had been sold by the end of November 2007, despite the $ 2.6 million price of each. For 2009 the price has risen to $ 3 million, but at least, ten slots (out of 67) are still looking for a buyer.
            General Motors, which ran 11 ads on Super Bowl Sunday in February 2008, has already said that it will not run any in 2009. America’s two other big carmakers, Ford and Chrysler, are likely to follow suit. Tellingly, Monster com, an online job-search company, said recently that it was buying a slot. To some extent, 2009’s Super Bowl will reflect a country in recession and indicate a hard year for the advertising industry.
            Most forecasts for next year say that ad spending in America will decline by 5% or more. Much depends on the fate of the automotive industry: carmakers and dealers normally spend around $ 20 billion a year on advertising, but Chrysler and Ford scaled back their expenditure by more than 30% in the first nine months of 2008, and are expected to make further cuts in 2009 as they struggle for survival.
            The car industry’s situation will hurt all media, but especially television. Analysts at BMO Capital Markets predict that total spending on television ads will fall by almost 9% next year. Only newspapers, where a decline of 12% is expected, are forecast to fare worse. Carmakers have already shifted some of their advertising spending to the Internet, and are likely to go further in 2009. Car ads make up 25% of advertising revenues for local television channels, and carmakers have been among the most consistent buyers of high-priced ads on national television.
            So far local stations have been most affected by falling spending on advertising. National stations have been safer, because they operate on longer-term contracts with advertisers. But in the New Year they will also feel the chill, as companies fail to renew their contracts. Television, which has remained strong as print media have lost advertising dollars and readers to the Internet, could enter a decline of its own. “Next on the list is TV stations,” says Anthony Diclemente, a media analyst at Barclays Capital.



    31.
    	
    Why does the author give the example of Super Bowl?
    A) Because it is the most popular football games in America.  
    B) Because it shows advertisers’ enthusiasm in running slots has dropped.  
    C) Because it is an event that attracts the attention of advertisers.  
    D) Because it will be right on in America in 2009.  

    正确答案： B
    32.
    	
    Why can’t at least ten slots find a buyer (Last sentence, Para. 1) according to the passage?
    A) The price for running the advertising slots has risen to $ 3 million.  
    B) It is not attractive any more for the advertising industry.  
    C) The advertising slots have been on the rise since 2007.  
    D) The advertising industry is suffering a hard year.  

    正确答案： D
    33.
    	
    What may the carmakers resort to for promoting their automobiles and cutting down expenditure?
    A) Shifting their advertising spending to the Internet.  
    B) Renewing new contracts with national stations.  
    C) Buying low-priced ads on national television.  
    D) Relying on such print media as newspaper.  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    What does the sentence “Next on the list is TV stations” ( last paragraph) said by Anthony Diclemente mean?
    A) What he is going to analyze next is TV stations.  
    B) What advertisers prefer to use is TV stations.  
    C) TV station is the next to be defeated by Internet.  
    D) He would choose TV station as a second choice.  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    We can learn from the passage that __________________.
    A) Ford and Chrysler will run the advertising slots in 2009  
    B) 2009’s Super Bowl will still be an expensive ads parade  
    C) America’s ad spending this year will decline by 5% or more  
    D) carmakers’ fate determines to certain extent the ad spending in America  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Speeding off in a stolen car, the thief thinks he has got a great catch. But he is in for an unwelcome surprise. The car is fitted with a remote immobilizer (锁止器), and a radio signal from a control centre miles away will ensure that once the thief switches the engine off, he will not be able to start it again.
            For now, such devices are only available for fleets of trucks and specialist vehicles used on construction sites. But remote immobilization technology could soon start to trickle down to ordinary cars, and should be available in the UK in two months.
            The idea goes like this. A control box fitted to the car contains a mini-cellphone, a micro-processor and memory, and a GPS satellite positioning receiver. If the car is stolen, a coded cellphone signal will tell the control centre to block the vehicle’s engine management system and prevent the engine being restarted.
            In the UK, a set of technical fixes is already making life harder for car thieves. “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed,” says Martyn Randall, a security expert. He says it would only take him a few minutes to teach a person how to steal a car, using a bare minimum of tools. But only if the car is more than 10 years old.
            Modern cars are far tougher to steal, as their engine management computer won’t allow them to start unless they receive a unique ID code beamed out by the ignition (点火) key. In the UK, technologies like this have helped achieve a 31% drop in vehicle-related crime since 1997.
            But determined criminals are still managing to find other ways to steal cars, often by getting bold of the owner’s keys. And key theft is responsible for 40% of the thefts of vehicles fitted with a tracking system.
            If the car travels 100 meters without the driver confirming their ID, the system will send a signal to an operations centre that it has been stolen. The hundred meters minimum avoids false alarms due to inaccuracies in the GPS signal.
            Staff at the centre will then contact the owner to confirm that the car really is missing, and keep police informed of the vehicle’s movements via the car’s GPS unit.



    36.
    	
    What’s the function of the remote immobilizer fitted to a car?
    A) To help the police make a surprise attack on the car thief.  
    B) To allow the car to lock automatically when stolen.  
    C) To prevent the car thief from restarting it once it stops.  
    D) To prevent car theft by sending a radio signal to the car owner.  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    By saying “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed” (Lines 1-2. Para. 4), Martyn Randall suggests that ________.
    A) it takes a longer time for the car thief to do the stealing  
    B) self-prepared tools are no longer enough for car theft  
    C) the thief has to make use of computer technology  
    D) the thief has lost interest in stealing cars over 10 years old  

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    _______________ is essential in making a modem car tougher to steal.
    A) A coded ignition key  
    B) A unique ID card  
    C) A special cellphone signal  
    D) A GPS satellite positioning receiver  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    Why does the tracking system set a 100-metre minimum before sending an alarm to the operations centre?
    A) To leave time for the operations centre to give an alarm.  
    B) To keep police informed of the car’s movements.  
    C) To give the driver time to contact the operations centre.  
    D) To allow for possible errors in the GPS system.  

    正确答案： D
    40.
    	
    What will the operations centre do first after receiving an alarm?
    A) Start the tracking system.  
    B) Contact the car owner.  
    C) Block the car engine.  
    D) Locate the missing car.
