    Script:         The family is changing. In the past, grandparents, parents, and children used to live together, and they had an extended family. But family structure is changing throughout the world. The nuclear family consists of only one father, one mother, and children; it is becoming the main family structure everywhere.
            The nuclear family offers married women some advantages: they have freedom from their relatives, and the husband does not have all the power of the family. Studies show that in nuclear families, men and women usually make an equal number of decisions about family life.
            But wives usually have to “pay” for the benefits of freedom and power. When women lived in extended families, sisters, grandparents and aunts helped one another with housework and childcare. In addition, older women in a large family group had important positions. Wives in nuclear families do not often enjoy this benefit, and they have another disadvantage, too: women generally live longer than their husbands, so older women from nuclear families often have to live alone. Studies show that women are generally less satisfied with marriage than men are. In the past, men worked outside the home and women worked inside. Housework and childcare were a full time job, and there was no time for anything else. Now women work outside and have more freedom than they did in the past, but they still have to do most of the housework. The women actually have two full-time jobs, and they have not much free time.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Increasingly, over the past ten years, people ― especially young people ― have become aware of the need to change their eating habits, because much of the food they eat, particularly chemical foods, is not good for health. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in natural foods: foods which do not contain chemical additives and which have not been affected by chemical fertilizers, widely used in farming today.
            Natural foods, for example, are vegetables, fruits and grains which have been grown in soil that is rich in organic matter. In simple terms, this means that the soil has been nourished by unused vegetable matter, which provides it with essential vitamins and minerals. This in itself is a natural process compared with the use of chemicals and fertilizers, the main purpose of which is to increase the amount ― but not the quality ― of foods grown in commercial farming areas.
            Natural foods also include animals which have been allowed to feed and move freely in healthy pastures. Compare this with what happens in the mass production of poultry: there are battery farms, for example, where thousands of chickens live crowded together in one building and are fed on food which is little better than rubbish. Chickens kept in this way are not only tasteless as food; they also produce eggs which lack important vitamins.
            There are other aspects of healthy eating which are now receiving increasing attention from experts on diet. Take, for example, the question of sugar. This is actually a non-essential food! Although a natural alternative, such as honey, can be used to sweeten food if this is necessary, we can in fact do without it. It is not that sugar is harmful in itself. But it does seem to be an additive: the quantity we use has grown steadily over the last two centuries and in Britain today each person consumes an average of 200 pounds a year! Yet all it does is provide us with energy, in the form of calories. There are no vitamins in it, no minerals and no fiber.
            It is significant that nowadays fiber is considered to be an important part of a healthy diet. In white bread, for example, the fiber has been removed. But it is present in unrefined flour and of course in vegetables. It is interesting to note that in countries where the national diet contains large quantities of unrefined flour and vegetables, certain diseases are comparatively rare. Hence the emphasis is placed on the eating of whole meal bread and more vegetables by modern experts on healthy eating.



    31.
    	
    Recently, some people are interested in natural foods because ______.
    A) natural foods are fresh and cheap  
    B) they don’t like processed foods  
    C) they want to change their eating habits  
    D) these foods contain more vitamins, mineral and fiber etc.  

    正确答案： D
    32.
    	
    According to the passage, what does the word “battery” (Para. 3) mean? ______
    A) apparatus for producing electricity  
    B) an array of similar things intended for use together  
    C) a line of small boxes in which hens are kept to lay eggs  
    D) a group or set of things like tools  

    正确答案： C
    33.

    A) white bread in which fiber has been removed  
    B) a type of brown bread which is made of unrefined flour  
    C) a kind of bread which can be used to cure diseases  
    D) a loaf of bread filled with hams and chicken  

    正确答案： B
    34.

    B) people will not necessarily do exercises in the future if they eat natural foods  
    C) natural foods will find a good market in the future

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Nowadays, more and more people are using e-mail to say a few nice words to each other. The result: a new culture of love-letter writing has evolved and is rewriting the rules in how we express our love.
            Make no mistake: in many cases the e-mail love letters significantly resemble their ancestor. The verbal imagery has hardly changed. Experts believe, in fact, that far more people now carry out sweet talk in cyberspace than in the time before e-mail came along. When people communicate over e-mail, everything is much more relaxed, less serious, and this helps the sweet words flow.
            Nicola Doering, a media researcher, emphasizes that for many people contact over e-mail is simpler: “The language is a different one here than in traditional letters; people tend to write more like they speak.” This means that an e-mail writer might not have to think over every word, as is often expected with traditional love letter. This is obviously encouraging for many people.
            But for longer, particularly romantic love letter, e-mail writers also reach back into the language of poetry, “Your calf-blue eyes” is typical for the kind of phrasings found in e-mail love letters. Moreover, at least one traditional symbol between lovers has made an outstanding comeback. Even in the love letters of the 19th century, one often found the letter X as a symbol of a kiss. Many paper love letters would have three X’s at the bottom as a closing. And this symbol is often used today between lovers in their e-mail messages.
            In spite of all the technological advancement that e-mail represents, classic love letters on paper still have a special meaning, the experts say. Ink on paper simply affects many people more strongly than lines on a computer screen. It appears more serious, more obligatory, as if written for all eternity. Sometimes people want to have something to touch, a letter that you can really hold in your hand.
            But Internet technology is ready to help even those with the courage to write a classic handwritten love letter. What stops many lovers from penning their most romantic thought is not a lack of good intention but an inability to piece together a few sweet lines, says Thomas Neuss, the organizer of one Internet site devoted to romantic letters.



    36.
    	
    The author strongly believes that ______.
    A) e-mail love letters are more significant than traditional ones  
    B) e-mail love letters are more convenient than traditional ones  
    C) most e-mail love letters copy sweet words from traditional ones  
    D) most e-mail love letters are quite similar to traditional ones  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    According to Nicola Doering, the distinguishing advantage of e-mail love letters is ______.
    A) more spoken language can be used  
    B) more sweet words will be employed  
    C) it will bring more romance to lovers  
    D) the message will be shorter and simpler  

    正确答案： A
    38.

    A) many people like using letters to express their love  
    B) traditional symbol between lovers has been popular  
    C) the traditional romantic expression is also employed in e-mails
