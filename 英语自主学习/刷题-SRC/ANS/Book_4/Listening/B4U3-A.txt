    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         If you feel the urge to lay your head down on the desk for an afternoon nap, here's something to tell your boss: a 90-minute snooze will actually help you remember that new task you just learned. Researchers at the University of Haifa published the results of their nap study in the journal Nature Neuroscience. They tested two groups ― each was asked to learn to bring their thumb and fingers together in a specific sequence. One took a 90-minute nap afterwards, the other didn't. The group that slept had learned the sequence better by nightfall. By morning the two groups had evened out, but researchers say the nappers improved more rapidly the next day.
            Then the scientists took another two groups. Both learned two different thumb-to-finger sequences over a few hours. One group took a nap in between the two tasks. At night-time, there was no difference between the groups. But by the morning, the nappers had learned the first task better. Scientists say this shows sleep in the afternoon help engrave new tasks into our long-term memory. Turns out that if you snooze, you win.
    12.
    	
    A) Scientists have done a lot of research on napping.  
    B) Taking a nap helps people to remember newly acquired information.  
    C) Long-term memory is more important.  
    D) Nappers are better employees.  
    Script: What is the main idea of this passage?

    正确答案： B
    13.
    	
    A) 30 minutes.

    D) 120 minutes.  
    Script: How many minutes' nap is recommended by the scientists?

    正确答案： C
    14.
    	
    A) Napping helps short-term memory.  
    B) Napping helps one's health.  
    C) Napping helps the memory of new tasks.  
    D) Napping helps to do the thumb-to-finger sequence task.  
    Script: What does the research show about the effects of taking a nap?

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Are smarter people drawn to music, theater and dance? Or does arts training in childhood change the brain in positive ways? In 2004, the philanthropic Dana Foundation created a group of neuroscientists from seven universities to address those questions. On March 4, the group released a report ― Learning, Arts, and the Brain, available at dana.org. Some of the findings:
            An interest in performing arts helps develop sustained attention spans, which can improve other areas of cognition. Links exist between training in music and the ability to manipulate information in both short-term and long-term memory. Music training also appears to improve kids' capacity for geometric representation, as well as the acquisition of reading skills. Acting classes lead to improved memory, via better language skills. Dance learning is done through observation and mimicry, and that training appears to improve other cognitive skills. So science says that dance, theater and music can make life full of sound and glory, signifying something.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Senior citizens, don't believe the ads. Because a new study finds that older folks who accept that seniors' memories get worse do worse on memory tests. The finding was published in the journal Experimental Aging Research.
            Scientists interested in the effects of stereotype on memory enlisted 103 seniors between 60 and 82 years old to take a memory test. Before the test, some subjects were told that the test checked the effects of age on memory. Researchers call this a threat ― it reminds participants of the stereotype. That group was also asked to write down their age after reading the instructions, again homing in on the stereotype.
            The other group was told that the test controlled for biases. This could make them feel more secure. Researchers also gave participants a questionnaire to test how strongly they bought into negative stereotypes.
            The results: Participants who got reminded of their age and the old-age, poor-memory stereotype did significantly worse. Those who say they feel stigmatized also performed more poorly. So your memory may function better just by believing that it will. In which case, you really will eventually figure out where you left your car keys.
