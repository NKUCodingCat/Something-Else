    Man: Then I’ve got some bad news for you. It’s been cancelled.

    Man: I know, but something must have gone wrong. They filmed two episodes, which they’ll air, but then there’ll be a mid-season replacement.
    Woman: This is unfair! I’ve been waiting nearly two years for its return. Oh well, at least I can watch my other favorite show tonight, Reviver.

    Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

    Script: Woman: I’m trying to decide whether to get cable or satellite TV. Which one do you have at your apartment?
    Man: I have satellite, but I used to have cable.
    Woman: What’s the difference?
    Man: Not a lot. With satellite, you have to have a satellite dish installed on the roof and you don’t with cable. Otherwise, you get similar options. You can get basic channels and choose from a lot of different premium channels. I have a package that includes the basic channels and some premium movie channels, and I also have a sports package so I can watch all of the soccer matches I want.
    Woman: How much is the monthly fee?
    Man: I think I pay $59.99 a month, excluding the taxes and fees, but the basic service is probably cheaper. When I had cable, I had to pay a deposit for the cable box, but with satellite, I had to buy the dish outright, but it wasn’t too expensive.
    Woman: What I want are pay-per-view channels, so I don’t need to run to the video rental store every time I want to watch a movie.
    Man: That’s not a problem. There’s video on demand on both cable and satellite, and there are a lot of movies to choose from.
    Woman: That’s great. I’ll check out whether my local cable company or satellite service has better packages and make a decision this weekend.
    Man: You could always start with the basic channels and then add services as you go along.
    Woman: That’s a good idea, especially since I know someone who has premium channels and round-the-clock soccer.
    Man: You bet. Drop by anytime, but don’t forget the beer and popcorn!

    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         The space shuttle Discovery landed on Wednesday, after 15 days in orbit above the Earth. NASA’s TV channel is available on the satellite system I have at home, so at one point during the mission, I tuned in. And there was an astronaut, live, in space, doing some construction work on the International Space Station.
            I’m not a fan of reality TV ― I’ve never seen Survivor or the Amazing Race or any of the other programs that get big ratings. But here was real reality TV, including a real Survivor ― Daniel Tani, an astronaut who had made it through multiple levels of tests to get chosen in the first place, who had then undergone years of rigorous training and who was at that very moment performing incredibly dangerous work in outer space! And that left me a bit confused. How is it that staged reality TV shows attract tens of millions of viewers, but the televised exploits of people risking their lives in space are pretty much ignored?
    12.
    	
    A) The landing of the space shuttle.  
    B) The launching of the space shuttle.  
    C) The orbit of the space shuttle.  
    D) The life of an astronaut living in space.  
    Script: What did the speaker see from NASA’s TV channel?

    正确答案： D
    13.
    	
    A) He is a big fan.  
    B) He is not a fan.  
    C) He never watches TV.  
    D) He often watches reality TV shows.  
    Script: What is the attitude of the speaker towards reality TV?

    正确答案： B
    14.
    	
    A) He was surprised to find that there are more people watching reality TV shows than those watching space exploration.  
    B) He was surprised to find that the NASA channel is so exciting.  
    C) He was wondering the reason why the astronauts are doing those movements in the outer space.  
    D) He was hoping to watch more reality TV later.  
    Script: What does the speaker mean by saying “that left me a bit confused”?

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         It’s hard to watch TV these days without seeing reality shows. Some nights, it’s hard to find a scripted drama to watch. There are so many different kinds of reality shows, too. The most popular one in the U.S. has been the American Idol show. This is a singing competition where amateurs try to impress the judges and the audience calls in to vote off a contestant each week. The last person left standing gets a recording contract. I think many countries now have a reality show like this. This show starts its fourth season this year and I think it’ll be more popular than ever.
            Another popular reality show is Big Brother. In this show, a group of people live together in the same house for about three months. They’re not allowed to leave and they can’t have visitors. The people chosen to live in the house are usually very different. This way, there is sure to be a lot of conflict. Some people form alliances and other people try to go it alone. The contestants compete in games and each week, the other contestants vote off one person from the show. Why would anyone want to be on Big Brother? The answer is easy: money. The last person remaining gets a huge prize in the U.S. show, half a million dollars. Even I’d live in a house full of strangers for that kind of cash.

    A) Big Brother.

    Script: How much can the last person remaining get at the end of the Big Brother show?

    正确答案： D

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         The latest fashion on British TV is reality TV. Reality TV means that shows follow and film ordinary people in an artificial situation. This could be at work, or in some kind of competition.
            One of the first and most popular reality TV shows is Big Brother. In this show, 15 complete strangers have to live together in a house for three months. They are filmed 24 hours a day, and shown on television. Each week, the viewers vote to evict one of the housemates. Finally, only one is left, and they win the prize money ― 50,000 pounds! The show was an instant hit, and runs in several countries. The housemates often become stars as a result of the show, and appear in national newspapers and on other shows.
            Another very popular show is I’m a Celebrity ― Get Me Out Of Here! In this show, 10 celebrities are taken to the Australian jungle. They have to complete tasks each week, such as eating insects. The show is very expensive to make. The show cost 10 million pounds to make, but over 12 million people in Britain watched the finale.
            Reality TV is also big business in the United States. American Idol, which is similar to the Chinese Super Girl, is one example. In this show, thousands of would-be singers audition in front of a panel of three judges. Part of the attraction is that many of the singers are not very good ― in fact, some are awful! The judges do not have to be polite, and are in fact usually very rude to some of the contestants. As the show progresses, viewers vote for their favorite singers and the number of singers goes down until only one is left. As a prize, they receive a recording contract with a major record company.
            Reality TV is coming to China, too. The hit US show, The Apprentice, featured the tycoon and multi-millionaire Donald Trump. In the new Chinese version, Wise Man Takes All, 16 would-be businessmen will present their ideas to the judges, and the best one will win 1 million Yuan to make their dream come true. Whatever happens, it seems reality TV is here to stay.

    A) It means shows follow movie stars or singers in their daily life.  
    B) It means shows follow and film ordinary people in an artificial situation.
