    Woman: We’re not over-the-hill! You may be an old man, but I still like to think of myself as middle-aged. Isn’t 70 the new 60?
    Man: That’s what they say, but I don’t mind aging. I may be a little absent- minded now and then, but I’m not weak. What I can’t stand is being treated like I am.

She waited on all of the tables around me first, and when she finally came to take my order, she didn’t even apologize.
    Woman: Ageism is everywhere. What I hate is to be talked to like I’m a child. Some people think that if you’ve got gray hair, you’re not all there. I’m as sharp as ever.
    Man: I know, but do you know what we’re doing?
    Woman: What?
    Man: We’re complaining. That’s what old people are supposed to do all the time, right?

    Script: Woman: Today is July 15th, I’m almost ready for my granddaughter’s visit. She’ll be here tomorrow and I want everything to be perfect.
    Man: What have you planned?
    Woman: I’m going to spoil her. My daughter is very strict and doesn’t allow her to do anything that a normal 10-year-old wants to do.
    Man: Like what?
    Woman: Well, her time is very structured and strictly controlled. She’s never been allowed any time for just fun.
    Man: And you’re taking off the restrictions.
    Woman: That’s right. She can play as much as she wants to for the next week. I don’t want her to miss out on any experiences just because her mother is overprotective. There will be no curfews and no time schedules.
    Man: Are you sure that’s a good idea? I’m sure your daughter has instructions about how your granddaughter should behave and the punishments she should get if she misbehaves.
    Woman: You’re right about that. I’m expecting a long list of rules for my granddaughter while she’s here, but she shouldn’t expect me to toe the line. I’m the grandmother after all, so I have special privileges. Nobody tells me what to do with my own granddaughter.
    Man: How did a free spirit like you end up with a daughter who is so strict with rules?
    Woman: Beats me.
    Man: She’s not going to thank you for spoiling her daughter, you know.
    Woman: I know, but I’m her mother and there’s still a thing or two I can teach her about raising a daughter!

    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Mm, blueberries. It’s the height of the season, and I’ve been tossing a handful into cereal, into pancakes or just straight into my mouth. This is a so-called SUPER fruit that may hold you back from aging and are considered extremely good to your eyes. Many of our crops were cultivated thousands of years ago, and we don’t know the individuals responsible. Not so for blueberries. Because the blueberry wasn’t planted by human beings until just about a century ago. And we have a botanist named Fred Coville to thank.
            In 1912 if you wanted blueberries, you picked the wild variety. And it was devilishly difficult to get the plants to grow anywhere but where they were naturally found. Coville figured out after many dead ends that blueberries need exceedingly acidic soil: most plants like the soil at a neutral pH of about 7. Blueberries do best when the pH is about 4.5.
            Colville also determined that blueberries can’t self-fertilize, so the grower must make sure the crop can be cross-pollinated. His research efforts are described in an article in the U.S. Department of Agriculture magazine Agricultural Research. So next time you pop a blueberry, don’t forget to thank Fred.

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         My formula for staying young is simple: concentrate on the part of you that’s young and growing your brain. Keep your mind awake and you’ll stay young all over. These are exciting times. Take an interest in the world around you, and make a point of learning at least one new thing every day.
            Regardless of your age, it’s not too late to make your life more interesting. I know a housewife with no previous knowledge who made herself into an outstanding industrial designer. I know a retired electrical engineer who has become a highly paid ceramic artist.
            Get over the notion that you are ever too old to go back to school. I know a man who entered medical college at 70. He got his doctor’s degree with honors and became an eminent physician. Another man went to law school at 71, and is now an active lawyer.
            In spite of years, staying young is easy for those who live in the future. You can do it if you care enough to try. Keep your mind awake and active; that’s only youth elixir guaranteed to work.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:      Senior citizen is a common polite designation for an elderly person in both UK and US English, and it implies or means that the person is retired. This in turn implies or in fact means that the person is over the retirement age, which varies according to country. Synonyms include pensioner in UK English and retiree and senior in US English. Some dictionaries describe widespread usage of "senior citizen" for people over the age of 65. "Senior citizen" is replacing the term old-age pensioner traditionally used in UK English.
            When defined in an official context, "senior citizen"is often used for legal or policy-related reasons in determining who is eligible for certain benefits available to the age group. It is used in general usage instead of traditional terms such as "old person", "old-age pensioner", or "elderly" as a courtesy and to signify continuing relevance of and respect for this population group as "citizens" of society, of "senior" rank.
            The term was apparently coined in 1938 during a political campaign. It has come into widespread use in recent decades in legislation, commerce, and common speech. Especially in less formal contexts, it is often abbreviated as "senior(s)", which is also used as an adjective. In commerce, businesses often offer "senior discounts", sometimes with a special "senior discount card".

    Script:         Aging is the process of growing old. It occurs eventually in every living thing provided, of course, that an illness or accident does not kill it prematurely. The most familiar outward signs of aging may be seen in old people, such as the graying of the hair and the wrinkling of the skin. Signs of aging in a pet dog or cat include loss of energy, a decline in hearing and eyesight, or even a slight graying of the coat. Plants age too, but the signs are much harder to detect.
            Most body parts grow bigger and stronger, and function more effectively during childhood. They reach their peak at the time of maturity, or early adulthood. After that, they begin to decline. Bones, for example, gradually become lighter and more brittle. In the aged, the joints between the bones also become rigid and more inflexible. This can make moving very painful.
            All the major organs of the body show signs of aging. The brain, for example, works less efficiently, and even gets smaller in size. Thinking process of all sorts are slowed down. Old people often have trouble in remembering the recent events. One of the most serious changes of old age occurs in the arteries, the blood vessels that lead from the heart. They become thickened and constricted, allowing less blood to flow to the rest of the body. This condition accounts, directly or indirectly, for many of the diseases of the aged. It may, for example, result in heart attacks.
            Aging is not a uniform process. Different parts of the body wear out at different rates. There are great differences among people in their rate of aging. Even the cells of the body differ in the way they age. The majority of cells are capable of reproducing themselves many times during the course of a lifetime. Nerve cells and muscle fibers can never be replaced once they wear out.
