    Script:         A recent online poll indicated 59.5% of netizens think negative of the county's neo-wealthy who shoot to fame on the annual rich lists, the China Youth Daily reported.
            As for the reasons behind their business success, 68.9% of netizens believe the new-rich have, or at least are good at securing, government connections. 12.7% of netizens cite the economic reform and loose policy as a factor, while only 9.3% contribute business strategy and personal struggle as a factor, according to the survey conducted by Sina.com and magazine People's Forum.
            Despite of the public discontent over those billionaires, it's a general trend that the group of new-rich will continue to grow during economic booming times, Wu Bi, a financial writer said. The increasing dissatisfaction may derive from the impression that the growth room for the general public has declined and it's harder to get rich now than before, Wu said.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         A World Book Day poll today reveals the top ten contemporary novels with genuine word-of-mouth appeal in a search to find the best book to talk about. Since the campaign was launched last November, over 3,000 book lovers have discussed and debated online the "talkability" merits of a list of 100 titles, including several hidden gems. World Book Day's shortlist ― which includes seven first novels ― shows the qualities of what really makes a discussion-worthy book in contemporary Britain: serious issues, character-led drama, and often a splash of humour.
            Judging by the books featured on the "Books to Talk About" shortlist, readers relish hard-hitting themes and challenging plots. Moreover, the strong showing of the independent publishing sector on the list confirms that it is currently in excellent health.
            The shortlist compiled by World Book Day (http://www.worldbookday.com) includes novels set during South Africa, wartime England and the Partition of India and Pakistan, revealing an appetite for powerful stories told against the background of the drama of recent history. Featuring subjects that include racially-motivated murder, mental breakdown, terminal illness, juvenile delinquency and the Moors murderer Myra Hindley, the shortlist of Books to Talk About indicates that readers relish emotional subjects, and enjoy talking about the social and personal issues that arise from a good story.
            Gods in Alabama, Joshilyn Jackson's gothic coming-of-age novel, emerged as the book clubs' favourite novel. 35 per cent of its votes came from members of reading groups.
            The most popular book amongst female readers was Jenny Downham's moving portrait of a 16-year-old battling leukaemia, Before I Die.
            Seven of the ten titles are first novels, proving that tough ideas and ambitious, evocative settings are alive and well in today's fictional debuts.
