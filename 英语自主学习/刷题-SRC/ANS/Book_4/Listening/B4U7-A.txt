    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         I decided to switch banks recently, and after looking at my options, I went for Mar Vista National Bank. I drove over to the bank, parked next to the drive through teller lanes, and walked inside. I made my way to the new accounts desk, and was greeted by John, one of the customer service representatives there. I told him I wanted to open a new checking and savings account. He said he would be happy to help me, and gave me a form to fill out with my personal information, including place of employment, home address, and so forth. I had to show him a government-issued ID and give him my social security number.
            John asked if I wanted an interest-bearing account with overdraft protection. Technically, he said, the savings account is a money market where I can earn interest daily. The checking was free if I had direct deposit, and my checks were also free. I signed on the dotted line, gave him the minimum deposit to open the account, and thanked him for his help. I’m glad I got that out of the way. Now all I need to do is make some money to put into my accounts!

    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Some people say that it’s civic duty to "give back" to your community. That’s true but for me, I want to do some volunteer work so that I can feel useful. I’ve been working at the same job for years and it’s not at all rewarding. Yes, I make good money, but I never feel like I’m doing any good in the world.
            When I was in college, I had dreams of changing the world. I wanted to work in a non-profit organization that did relief work, that helped women and children in need, or that had an impact on public policy. I’ve begun to think again about those dreams and thought I might take the first step of doing some volunteering. Then, I can see if I like that kind of work and make some hard decisions.
            I called an organization that helped homeless children. I told them about my education and experience, and they said they could use someone like me to do some tutoring. I filled out an application and was fingerprinted for a background check. A few weeks later, I met my student and I tutored her for the first time. It was a great experience. I wish I had done it earlier!

When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.


            If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is. Wealth is not the same thing as money. Wealth is as old as human history. Money is a comparatively recent invention.
            Wealth is the (21)_________________ thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on (22)_________________ make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn’t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of (23)_________________ , where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn’t matter how much money you had.
            Money is a side effect of (24)_________________ . In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can’t make for yourself. If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.
            How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some? By giving him something he wants in return. But you can’t get very far by (25)_________________ things directly with the people who need them. If you make violins, and none of the local farmers wants one, what will you eat?

Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we’ve been using a medium of exchange, called the dollar, that doesn’t physically exist. It works as a medium of exchange, however, because its rarity is (29)_________________ by the U.S. government.
            The advantage of a medium of (30)_________________ is that it makes trade work. The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really means.
            People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage ― just a shorthand ― for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make wealth. They do something people want.

            Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn’t need money.
