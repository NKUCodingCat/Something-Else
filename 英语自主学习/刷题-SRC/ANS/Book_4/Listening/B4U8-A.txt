    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         After entering World War II in December 1941, the United States enacted legislation to help direct the civilian economy to military production. At that time, military contracts were typically awarded to manufacturers who submitted the lowest competitive bid. Upon delivery, products were inspected to ensure conformance to requirements.
            During this period, quality became a means to safety. Unsafe military equipment was clearly unacceptable, and the armed forces inspected virtually every unit of product to ensure that it was safe for operation. This practice required huge inspection forces and caused problems in recruiting and retaining competent inspection personnel.
            To ease the problems without compromising product safety, the armed forces began to utilize sampling inspection to replace unit-by-unit inspection. With the aid of industry consultants, particularly the Bell Laboratories, they adapted sampling tables and published them in a military standard: Mil-Std-105. The tables were incorporated into the military contracts themselves. In addition to creating military standards, the armed forces helped their suppliers improve their quality by sponsoring training courses in Shewhart's statistical quality control (SQC) techniques. While the training led to quality improvements in some organizations, most companies had little motivation to truly integrate the techniques. As long as government contracts paid the bills, organizations' top priority remained meeting production deadlines. Most SQC programs were terminated once the government contracts came to an end.

    Script:         On Tuesday, pirates launched an attack on "Liberty Sunday", which carries food aid for the UN World Food Program, and a crew of 20 Americans. The pirates fired at the ship with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons. But the American crew blockaded themselves in the engine room. Later, the crew escaped and headed to Kenya under US Navy guard.
            US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Wednesday, the US State Department will work with shippers and insurers to improve their defenses against pirates. It's part of the US's decision to fight against attacks on commercial ships off the Somali coast.
            Hillary Rodham Clinton, US Secretary of State, said, "You have to go after the land bases. We have a pretty good idea where the land bases are. And we want to know what the Somali government, what tribal leaders, who perhaps would not like to have the international community bearing down on them, would be willing to do to rid their territory of these pirate bases."
            There has been a recent surge in pirate attacks in the region. US President Barack Obama has vowed to take action against the pirates. And five pirates have been killed in French and US hostage rescues. But this hasn't stopped sea-going gangs from seizing four vessels and more than 75 hostages since Sunday's dramatic rescue of the American captain.
            In all, Somali pirates have attacked 79 ships this year and successfully hijacked a quarter of them. Currently, they are holding over 280 sailors on 15 ships. And at least 76 of those sailors were captured in the last few days.

    Script:         The military aspect of the United States Civil War has always attracted the most attention from scholars. The roar of gunfire, the massed movements of uniformed men, the shrill of bugles, and the drama of hand-to-hand combat have fascinated students of warfare for a century.
            Behind the lines, however, life was less spectacular. It was the story of back-breaking labor to provide the fighting men with food and arms, of nerve-tingling uncertainty about the course of national events, of heartbreak over sons or brothers or husbands lost in battle. If the men on the firing line won the victories, the means to those victories were forged on the home front.
            Never in the nation's history had Americans worked harder for victory than in the Civil War. Northerners and Southerners alike threw themselves into the task of supplying their respective armies.
            Both governments made tremendous demands upon civilians and, in general, received willing coorperations. By 1863 the Northern war economy was rumbling along in high gear. Everything from steamboats to shovels was needed and produced. Denied Southern cotton, textile mills turned to wool for blankets and uniforms. Hides by the hundreds of thousands were turned into shoes and harness and saddles; ironworks manufactured weapons, engines and plate. Where private enterprise lagged, the government set up its own factories. Agriculture boomed, with machinery doing the job of farm workers drawn into the army. In short, everything that a nation needed to fight a modern war was produced in uncounted numbers.
