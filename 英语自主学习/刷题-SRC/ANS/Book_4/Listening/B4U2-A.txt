    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Some good news from the world of advertising? Well, yes. Because ads for nicotine patches and other ways to quit smoking actually do work ― and they work even if you don’t buy the product being advertised.
            That’s the finding of a study to be published by Cornell researchers in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Political Economy in 2011. Because although some people who saw ads did buy the products being advertised, it seems that just seeing the ads convinces other people to try to quit, regardless of how they do it. The phenomenon of influencing consumers beyond the advertised method is known as the spillover effect.
            A 2006 study by the same authors found that consumers see more ads for over-the-counter-stop-smoking products than for those available only by prescription. Over-the-counter-stop-smoking aids are more heavily advertised. So if more products were available over the counter, there would presumably be more advertising, which in turn could lead to a lot more former smokers, regardless of how they stop.

    A) Seeing ads for ways to quit smoking can help people to stop smoking.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law Monday bill regulating the nation's tobacco industry. The bill gives the federal government the ability to regulate the production and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products.
            Decades after the dangers of tobacco first became known, the strongest anti-smoking legislation in U.S. history has been signed into law by the President.
            The measure does not criminalize tobacco or limit the availability of tobacco products to adults. But it will have a big impact on the way cigarettes are produced and sold ― particularly to young people. President Obama says protecting children is what the bill is all about.
            "Each day, 1,000 young people under the age of 18 become new, regular, daily smokers," he said. "And almost 90 percent of smokers began at or before their 18th birthday."
            The president says he knows the problem too well.
            "I was one of these teenagers, and so I know how difficult it can be to break this habit when it's been with you for a long time," he said. "And I also know that kids today don't just start smoking for no reason. They're aggressively targeted as customers by the tobacco industry."
            For the first time, a government agency ― the Food and Drug Administration or FDA ― will have the authority to regulate tobacco products.
            Mr. Obama noted that under the new law, the FDA can ban certain substances in cigarettes and restrict the marketing techniques used by tobacco companies.
            "It will curb the ability of tobacco companies to market products to our children by using appealing flavors," he said. "It will force these companies to more clearly and publicly acknowledge the harmful and deadly effects of the products they sell."
            The President signed the legislation at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden surrounded by members of Congress and representatives of health advocacy groups ― including three children from an organization called "The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids."
    18.
    	
    A) A bill gives the federal government the ability to regulate the production and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products.  
    B) A bill advocates anti-smoking campaign.  
    C) A bill allows FDA to ban cigarette production and stop the advertisement on smoking.  
    D) A bill forbids the young people to smoke in the public.

    D) FDA can choose the advertisement of cigarette products.  
    Script: What authority does the FDA have after the legislation?

    正确答案： B
    20.
    	
    A) It will force these companies to stop advertising cigarettes.  
    B) It will force these companies to more clearly and publicly acknowledge the harmful and deadly effects.  
    C) It will force these companies to reduce their cigarettes’ production and advertising in public places.  
    D) It will force these companies to warn the public and ask the public to quit smoking.  
    Script: What influence will the bill have on companies which produce or sell tobacco?

    正确答案： B

    Script:         Drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes appear to increase the risk of certain common throat and stomach cancers, Dutch researchers reported on Monday.
            The findings, presented at an American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington, underline other health recommendations for people to follow a healthy lifestyle and drink and smoke only in moderation.
            "It appeared that current smokers have the highest risks, and former smokers have an intermediate risk compared with never smokers," Jessie Steevens, an epidemiologist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, said in a statement.
            The incidence of stomach cancer has fallen dramatically in the United States and western Europe over the past 60 years but the disease remains a serious problem in much of the rest of the world, where it is a leading cause of cancer death, according to the Mayo Clinic.
            Throat cancer is a form of cancer that starts in the inner layer of the throat, the 10-inch-long tube that connects the throat to the stomach.
            Other studies have linked throat cancer in general to drinking and smoking, but Steevens and colleagues wanted to refine the risk of the different types of the tumours.
            Smoking was associated with an increased risk of the throat cancer. "These are the results when no other aspects of smoking were considered, such as the amount of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years a person smoked," Steevens said.
            "When we took into account the smoking duration and frequency, it appeared that the difference in risk between former smokers and current smokers could partly be explained by these other aspects of smoking."
