    Man: No, she won’t, and why are you giving me such a hard time? It’s not like you’ve never lied before.
    Woman: I may cut class now and then, but I have a foolproof way of doing it so I don’t get caught.

    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         With the increasing number of foreigners moving to China, many families face difficult decisions when it comes to their children’s education. But while some pay as much as 20,000 yuan ($2,980) a month for international schools or show concern about Chinese-language-only instruction in local schools, more expat parents, like American Julie Johnson, are now turning to a third alternative, homeschooling.
            Johnson started teaching her 11-year-old daughter Kaylen Hou in Taiwan before the family moved to Beijing three years ago. Following an online curriculum from the US, Johnson, who holds a master’s degree in Chinese literature, teaches her daughter everything from mathematics to geography. “Foreigners who are blessed with expat package may not think too much about their schooling options,” Johnson told the Global Times. “But as more families move here who do not have tuition covered, they want to explore other options.”
            Homeschooling does not mean sitting at home. Besides three hours of study, Hou’s schedule is fully packed with yoga, swimming, music and dance classes. Johnson also takes her daughter on field trips around China, which she believes is a better and more interesting way to learn about a foreign country.
            Along with other local parents, Johnson founded the Beijing Homeschoolers Network, a community for families to share resources and organize group activities. According to Johnson, head of Beijing Homeschoolers, its membership has grown from only a few to more than 100 in three years, and Johnson believes there are more out there.

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         A new school year has begun in America. But some children do not go to school. Instead, they learn at home, usually with their parents as teachers. Educational companies, libraries, school systems and the Internet provide families with teaching materials.
            Homeschooling is increasingly popular. Homeschooling groups estimate that 2 million children, around two percent, learn at home. The last government estimate was 850,000 in 1999. Current numbers are not expected until next year.
            Some parents choose homeschooling because of their religious beliefs. Others say it provides more time for the family to be together. Many parents also believe homeschooling avoids problems of a lot of traditional schools. One problem is classes with too many students. Critics, though, say children need to attend school with other children to help them learn things like social skills. They also say that some homeschooled children do not get a very good education.
            All fifty states and the District of Columbia permit homeschooling. Some, however, require more preparation by parents or testing of children than others do.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Homeschooling is as old as the country. In farm areas, people often lived far from a school. Then, in 1852, the state of Massachusetts passed the first law to require children to attend school. The public education system grew. By the 1960s and ‘70s, however, some Americans believed that traditional education was not helping their children. So a number of parents began homeschooling.
            Homeschool expert Linda Dobson says some parents began to teach their children at home when some religious schools closed. This happened after changes in tax laws in the 1980s. Since then, she says, more people have joined the movement ― rich and poor, and people from many races, religions and political beliefs. There is even a National Home School Honor Society. Membership is based in part on the same tests that students take in school.
            Homeschooled children go to college and have also won top competitions. These include this year’s National Geographic Bee. Fourteen-year-old James Williams knew that the Indian state of Goa is a former colony of Portugal.
