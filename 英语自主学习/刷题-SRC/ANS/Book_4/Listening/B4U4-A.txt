    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         People from different cultures have very different feelings about hugging and touching. Some Americans may touch the arm of the person they are talking to while they are speaking. A man may gently slap another man on the back when greeting him. Many Americans hug their family members and good friends when they greet them or say goodbye. However, some Americans do not enjoying being hugged in public. There is a great variety of feelings about hugging strangers. Some people will warmly hug a new person they are introduced to. Others may take a long time before they give a friend a hug when they say hello or goodbye. People from South America or southern Europe frequently touch the person they are speaking to. They touch on the arm, hand, or shoulder. People from Japan seldom touch at all when speaking to others. In China, boys may put their arms around other boys, and girls may walk arm-in-arm or even holding hands. However, in America, boys do not put their arms around other boys. If you do, people will consider you odd.
            In a social group, American women often sit with their ankles crossed, or sometimes their legs crossed at the knee. Men often sit with one leg crossing the other, with the ankle resting on the knee. However, in China, if you sit in this way, you are considered to be rude or impolite. Chinese people are asked to sit with two legs at the same level, and with your feet on the ground. In the United States, where being casual and friendly is valued, people often fall into chairs when they sit. In many countries, such as Germany, and Sweden, where lifestyles tend to be more formal, slouching is considered a sign of rudeness and poor manners.
    12.
    	
    A) They may touch the arm of the person they are talking to.  
    B) They may slap another man on the back.  
    C) They may kiss a lady on the cheek.

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Foreigners are not expected to know all of these things the minute they step off the plane and will be given great latitude, however your knowledge of what is not acceptable can make your transition to life in China much smoother.
            If you want someone to come to you, don't wave them over with an upturned finger. This is impolite. Wave them over with your fingers turned down, as if they were sweeping something toward you. The same motion is used when hailing a cab.
            When using a toothpick in public, cover your mouth with your hand.
            When eating with a group, if there is a dish everyone is sharing (which is customary), do not use your chopsticks or the spoon you are eating with to dish your food. Use the serving spoon to dish into your bowl or plate and then use your spoon or chopsticks to eat.
            If someone gives you a present, it's best not to open it in front of them.
            When someone gives a business card to you, do not stick it in your hip pocket. Also, don't stick it in your wallet and then put your wallet in your hip pocket. You would be symbolically stating that you want to sit on them! Putting a business card in your wallet and then placing the wallet in a front pocket is no problem.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         In the United States, it's important to be on time for appointments, classes, meetings, etc. This isn't true in all countries, however. An American professor discovered this difference while teaching a class in a Brazilian university. The two-hour class was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and end at noon. On the first day, when the professor arrived on time, there was no one in the classroom. Many students came after 10 a.m.; several arrived after 10:30 a.m. Two students came after 11 a.m. Although all the students greeted the professor as they arrived, few apologized for their lateness. Were these students being rude? He decided to study the students' behavior.
            The professor talked to American and Brazilian students about lateness in both informal and formal situations; lunch with a friend and a university class. He gave them an example and asked them how they would react. If they had a lunch appointment with a friend, the average American students defined lateness as 19 minutes after the agreed time. On the other hand, the Brazilian student felt the friend was late after 33 minutes.

    Script:         As we interact with others of different cultures, there is no good substitute for willingness to interpersonal feedback, good observation skills, effective questions, and some horse sense. There is much to be gained by observing how people of the same culture interact with each other. Don't be afraid to ask questions as most people respond very positively to inquiries about their culture. Ask a variety of people so you can get a balanced view.
            Making a genuine effort to find the positive historical, literary, and cultural contributions of a society; learning a few polite expressions in another person's language; and showing appreciation for the food and music of another culture can have especially positive effects.

    Script:         The military aspect of the United States Civil War has always attracted the most attention from scholars. The roar of gunfire, the massed movements of uniformed men, the shrill of bugles, and the drama of hand-to-hand combat have fascinated students of warfare for a century.
            Behind the lines, however, life was less spectacular. It was the story of back-breaking labor to provide the fighting men with food and arms, of nerve-tingling uncertainty about the course of national events, of heartbreak over sons or brothers or husbands lost in battle. If the men on the firing line won the victories, the means to those victories were forged on the home front.
            Never in the nation's history had Americans worked harder for victory than in the Civil War. Northerners and Southerners alike threw themselves into the task of supplying their respective armies.
            Both governments made tremendous demands upon civilians and, in general, received willing coorperations. By 1863 the Northern war economy was rumbling along in high gear. Everything from steamboats to shovels was needed and produced. Denied Southern cotton, textile mills turned to wool for blankets and uniforms. Hides by the hundreds of thousands were turned into shoes and harness and saddles; ironworks manufactured weapons, engines and plate. Where private enterprise lagged, the government set up its own factories. Agriculture boomed, with machinery doing the job of farm workers drawn into the army. In short, everything that a nation needed to fight a modern war was produced in uncounted numbers.

    Part II    Oral Tasks  ( 2 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Interpret the following Chinese passage into English. You can either interpret it sentence by sentence or give out the main points in your own words. You will have two minutes for preparation and three minutes for interpretation.
    41.	奥林匹克精神的实质（essence）和普遍价值观――团结、友谊、进步、和谐、参与和梦想，表达了全世界在奥林匹克精神的感召下，追求人类美好未来的共同愿望。

    思考/准备


    Section B 

    The use of cutlery (餐具) in eating may differ from culture to culture, influenced by a thread in another form; I'm interested in knowing how your culture eats "formally". As an example, if you are invited to dine at someone's house in Europe, you will be given a fork and knife to use while eating while in China you would be given chopsticks. How is the standard method in eating in your culture and how does the culture, in general not as individuals, feel about people who request different cutlery when dining with you? Would you feel insulted or indifferent? You will have two minutes for preparation and three minutes for presentation.
