    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            When school was out, I hurried to find my sister and get out of the schoolyard before seeing anybody in my class. But Barbara and her friends had beaten us to the playground entrance and they seemed to be waiting for us. Barbara said, "So now you're in the A class." She sounded impressed. "What's the A class?" I asked. Everybody made superior yet faintly envious giggling sounds. "Well, why did you think the teacher moved you to the front of the room, dopey? Didn't you know you were in the C class before, way in the back of the room?"     　　
            Of course I hadn't known. The Wenatchee fifth grade was bigger than my whole school which had been in North Dakota, and the idea of subdivisions within a grade had never occurred to me. The subdividing for the first marking period had been done before I came to the school, and l had never, in the six weeks when I'd been there, talked to anyone long enough to find out about the A, B, and C classes.     　　
            I still could not understand why that had made such a difference to Barbara and her friends. I didn’t yet know that it was shameful and dirty to be a transient laborer and ridiculous to be from North Dakota. I thought living in a tent was more fun than living in a house.     　　
            I didn't know that we were gypsies, really (how that thought would have excited me then! ). It didn't occur to me that we were all looked upon as one more of the untrustworthy natural phenomena, drifting here and there like mists or winds, I didn't know that I was the only child who had camped on the Baumann's land ever to get out of the C class.    　　
            I only knew that for two happy days I walked to school with Barbara and her friends, played hopscotch and jumped rope with them at class intervals, and was even invited into the house for some ginger ale ― a strange drink I had never tasted before.

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Imagine a mass of floating waste is two times the size of the state of Texas. Texas has a land area of more than 678,000 square kilometers. So it might be difficult to imagine anything twice as big.
            All together, this mass of waste flowing in the North Pacific Ocean is known as the Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch. It weighs about 3,500,000 tons.
            The eastern part of the Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch is about l,600 kilometers west of California. The western part is west of the Hawaiian Islands and east of Japan. The area has been described as a kind of oceanic desert，with light winds and slow moving water currents. The water moves so slowly that garbage from all over the world collects there.
            In recent years, there have been growing concerns about the floating garbage and its effect on sea creatures and human health. Scientists say thousands of animals get trapped in the floating waste, resulting in death or injury. Even more die from a lack of food or water after swallowing pieces of plastic.
            The floating garbage can also have harmful effects on people. There is an increased threat of infection of disease from polluted waste, and from eating fish that swallowed waste. Divers can also get trapped in the plastic.
            Its existence first gained public attention in l997. That was when racing boat captain and oceanographer Charles Moore and his crew sailed into the garbage while returning from a racing event. Five years earlier, another oceanographer learned of the trash after a shipment of rubber ducks got lost at sea. Many of those toys are now part of the Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch.
            In August, 2009, a team from the University of California, San Diego became the latest group to travel to it. They were shocked by the amount of waste they saw. They gathered hundreds of sea creatures and water samples to measure the garbage patch's effect on ocean environment.

    37.
    	
    What do we know about the Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch?
    A) It is made up of various kinds of plastic products.  
    B) It is a solid mass of floating waste materials.  
    C) It lies l60,000 kilometers east of California.  
    D) It is described as a kind of oceanic desert.

    B) Because the polluted plastic articles will move up the food chain.
