    Script:         Good grades and a good job are easy to get. A good education is a different story.
            Her eyelids sagged from lack of sleep, but Teresa’s exams were always impeccable, her essays longer than required, and her math problems rewritten to ensure neatness. She played the violin and the piano, volunteered at the hospital, participated in various school clubs and enjoyed none of it. Born to succeed, it seemed, she was more than willing to sacrifice herself in the name of achievement. I watched as her laughter dissolved.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Personality is to a large extent inherent. A-type parents usually bring A-type offspring. But the environment must also have a profound effect if competition is important to the parents. It is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.
            One place where children soak up A characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the "win at all costs" moral standard and measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children compete with their classmates or against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer system, in which competitive A-types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the first marathon (马拉松) runner, dropped dead seconds after saying: "Rejoice, we conquer!"
            By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate emphasis on examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful.
            Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A youngsters change into B's. The world needs A types, and schools have an important duty to try to fit a child's personality to his possible future employment. It is top management.
            If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, more time might be spent teaching children surer values. Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially medicine, could be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as sensitivity and sympathy. It is surly a mistake to choose our doctors exclusively from A-type stock. B's are important and should be encouraged.

    D) B-types can find no place in a competitive society  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Education is one of the key words of our time. A man without an education, many of us believe, is an unfortunate victim of unfortunate circumstances deprived of one of the greatest twentieth-century opportunities. Convinced of the importance of education, modern states “invest” in institutions of learning to get back “interest” in the form of a large group of enlightened young men and women who are potential leaders. Education, with its cycles of instruction so carefully worked out, punctuated by textbooks ― those purchasable wells of wisdom ― what would civilization be like without its benefits?
            So much is certain that we would have doctors and preachers, lawyers and defendants, marriages and births; but our spiritual outlook would be different. We would lay less stress on “facts and figures” and more on a good memory, on applied psychology, and on the capacity of a man to get along with his fellow-citizens.
            If our educational system were fashioned after its bookless past we would have the most democratic form of “college” imaginable. Among the people whom we like to call savages all knowledge inherited by tradition is shared by all; it is taught to every member of the tribe so that in this respect everybody is equally equipped for life.
            It is the ideal condition of the “equal start” which only our most progressive forms of modern education try to regain. In primitive cultures the obligation to seek and to receive the traditional instruction is binding to all. There are no “illiterates” ― while our own compulsory school attendance became law in Germany in 1642, in France in 1806, and in England in 1976, and is still nonexistent in a number of “civilized” nations. This shows how long it was before we deemed it necessary to make sure that all our children could share in the knowledge accumulated by the “happy few” during the past centuries.
            Education in the wilderness is not a matter of monetary means. All are entitled to an equal start. There is none of the hurry which, in our society, often hampers the full development of a growing personality. There, a child grows up under the ever-present attention of his parents; therefore the jungles and the savages know of no “juvenile delinquency”. No necessity of making a living away from home results in neglect of children, and no father is confronted with his inability to “buy” an education for his child.
