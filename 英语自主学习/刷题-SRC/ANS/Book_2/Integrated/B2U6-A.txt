    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Holidays usually help us remember what irritates us most about family.
            The husband who waits until the last minute to shop. The children who poison cherished family time with bad tempers. The sister-in-law who criticizes the father who complains.
            This is also the time of year when we are together with people with whom we have long-time conflicts. The black mood that spoils holiday gatherings is a result of having three or four generations under one roof. There is tremendous conflict of values, and you can't negotiate values.
            The result: Everybody gets their hot buttons pushed, and emotions explode.
    These hot buttons have familiar labels.
    ― Minimizing: "It's not that big a deal."
    ― Degrading: "You are just a kid; what do you know?"
    ― Blaming: "You always ― "
    ― Comparing: "You are just your father."
    ― Judging: "That's the silliest idea I ever heard."
    ― Name-calling: "You are being ridiculous."
    ― And dictating: "I know better. Do it my way."
            These are the top 10 hot buttons, and during the holidays they get pushed over and over. You even know who is going to say what and when.
            Nobody wants a blow-up on a holiday, so we ignore and ignore. But those disagreements stay with us and things become worse at the next family gathering.
            Here are ways to diffuse these emotional moments.
            Acknowledge the intentions of the speaker: "I know you mean well."
            Say how you feel. "It hurts me when you make fun of my work."
            Or give the speaker a face-saving option: "If you are worried that I am not cooking enough food, why don't you bring one of your favorite dishes."
            Most of the communication is in body language and tone of voice. You need to say it in an open, warm and caring way.
            Don't expect every disagreement to be resolved. Sometimes you just need to say, "Let's talk about this again later." You are not giving up or giving in. you are keeping your dignity and moving on.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            When I was in 7th grade, I had a lot of trouble reading. My mother used to sit by my side, and explain each paragraph of each school reading assignment to me because I didn't understand what I was reading. She would have to read each paragraph to me, and then after each paragraph, she summarized what we just read.
            In class, I tried to hide the fact that I couldn't read. My teachers gave us the last 10 minutes of class to start our reading homework, and I would sit there for the last ten minutes of class staring at the page, pretending I was reading it ― I remember a terrible feeling of not wanting to get in trouble for not being able to comprehend. I had to wait until I got home so my mother could explain it to me. How did I ever get into Cornell University? By eighth grade I started understanding a little on my own, but I was reading at an incredibly slow rate. In eighth grade, I got hold of all the speed reading books I could get my hands on. I read them all very slowly at the time. I even went out and took a course on speed reading. Then I developed my own system which was easier and produced quicker results. I started practicing these techniques every day, and as I started to read faster, my understanding increased. I found that I stopped daydreaming and thinking about other things while I was reading, and started getting the larger meaning. I was reading faster and comprehending better.
            I found that when you read slowly, word by word, you get lost in the words, lose the bigger picture, and your comprehension drops. When you read faster, your concentration actually increases and your comprehension goes up because instead of getting lost in the words, you see the overall picture.
