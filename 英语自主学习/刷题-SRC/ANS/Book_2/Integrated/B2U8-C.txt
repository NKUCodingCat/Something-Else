    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            When school was out, I hurried to find my sister and get out of the schoolyard before seeing anybody in my class. But Barbara and her friends had beaten us to the playground entrance and they seemed to be waiting for us. Barbara said, "So now you're in the A class." She sounded impressed. "What's the A class?" I asked. Everybody made superior yet faintly envious giggling sounds. "Well, why did you think the teacher moved you to the front of the room, dopey? Didn't you know you were in the C class before, way in the back of the room?"     　　
            Of course I hadn't known. The Wenatchee fifth grade was bigger than my whole school which had been in North Dakota, and the idea of subdivisions within a grade had never occurred to me. The subdividing for the first marking period had been done before I came to the school, and l had never, in the six weeks when I'd been there, talked to anyone long enough to find out about the A, B, and C classes.     　　
            I still could not understand why that had made such a difference to Barbara and her friends. I didn’t yet know that it was shameful and dirty to be a transient laborer and ridiculous to be from North Dakota. I thought living in a tent was more fun than living in a house.     　　
            I didn't know that we were gypsies, really (how that thought would have excited me then! ). It didn't occur to me that we were all looked upon as one more of the untrustworthy natural phenomena, drifting here and there like mists or winds, I didn't know that I was the only child who had camped on the Baumann's land ever to get out of the C class.    　　
            I only knew that for two happy days I walked to school with Barbara and her friends, played hopscotch and jumped rope with them at class intervals, and was even invited into the house for some ginger ale ― a strange drink I had never tasted before.



    31.
    	
    The tone of this passage as a whole is __________.
    A) reflective  
    B) enthusiastic  
    C) impersonal  
    D) defensive  

    正确答案： A
    32.

    A) she was a poor reader  
    B) she had come from a small school  
    C) the marking system confused her  
    D) all children of transient laborers were placed in the C class  

    正确答案： D
    33.
    	
    The basic reason why people in the community distrusted the transient workers was that the transient workers ________.
    A) tended to be lawbreakers  
    B) had little schooling  
    C) were afraid of strangers  
    D) were temporary residents  

    正确答案： D
    34.

    A) Wandering around the world.  
    B) Making ginger ale in their house.  
    C) Never planting something.  
    D) Being foreigners wherever they go.  

    正确答案： B
    35.
    	
    Immediately after the narrator was moved to the A class, what was the attitude of Barbara and Barbara's friends towards her?
    A) Dislike.  
    B) Acceptance.  
    C) Apology.  
    D) Jealousy.  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            More and more, the operations of our business, governments, and financial institutions are controlled by information that exists only inside computer memories. Anyone clever enough to modify this information for his own purposes can reap substantial rewards. Even worse, a number of people who have done this and been caught at it have managed to get away without punishment.     　　
            It's easy for computer crimes to go undetected if no one checks up on what the computer is doing, but even if the crime is detected, the criminal may walk away not only unpunished but with a glowing recommendation from his former employers. Of course, we have no statistics on crimes that go undetected. But it's disturbing to note how many of the crimes we do know about were detected by accident, not by systematic inspections or other security procedures. The computer criminals who have been caught may have been the victims of uncommonly bad luck. 　　
            For example, a certain keypunch operator complained of having to stay overtime to punch extra cards. Investigation revealed that the extra cards she was being asked to punch were for dishonest transactions. In another case, dissatisfied employees of the thief tipped off the company that was being robbed. Unlike other lawbreakers, who must leave the country, commit suicide, or go to jail, computer criminals sometimes escape punishment, demanding not only that they not be charged but that they be given good recommendations and perhaps other benefits. All too often, their demands have been met.     　
            Why? Because company executives are afraid of the bad publicity that would result if the public found out their computer had been misused.
            They hesitate at the thought of a criminal boasting in open court of how he juggled the most confidential records right under the noses of the company's executives, accountants, and security staff. And so another computer criminal departs with just the recommendations he needs to continue his crimes elsewhere.



    36.
    	
    It can be concluded from the passage that _______.
    A) it is still impossible to detect computer crimes today  
    B) computer crimes are one of most serious problems in the operation of the financial institutions  
    C) computer criminals can escape punishment because they can't be detected  
    D) people commit computer crimes at the request of their company  

    正确答案： B
    37.
    	
    It is implied in the third paragraph that _______.
    A) more computer crimes go undetected than are discovered  
    B) the rapid increase of computer crimes is a troublesome problem  
    C) most computer criminals are smart enough to cover up their crimes  
    D) most computer criminals who are caught blame their bad luck  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    Which of the following is mentioned in the passage?
    A) A strict law against computer crimes must be enforced.  
    B) Companies need to impose restrictions on confidential information.  
    C) Companies will guard against computer crimes to protect their reputation.  
    D) Companies usually hesitate to uncover computer crimes.  

    正确答案： D
    39.
    	
    The underlying reason for the computer criminals to get recommendations he needs is that _______.
    A) they have skills formidably difficult for others to master  
    B) the employers are afraid that they would take avenge if punished  
    C) the employers are much afraid of bringing the public into disbelief towards them through the criminals' words in open court  
    D) those who commit crimes do not mean bad  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    What may happen to computer criminals once they are caught?
    A) With bad reputation they can hardly find another job.  
    B) They will be denied access to confidential records.  
    C) They may walk away and easily find another job.  
    D) They must leave the country or go to jail.
