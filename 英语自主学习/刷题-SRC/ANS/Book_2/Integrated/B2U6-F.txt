            But while I was feeling uneasy about the bridge I'd just   21    , I also began to feel a renewed sense of hopefulness about the   22    on the other side. I had had a long love affair with the written word that was   23    and apart from any of my roles. What we shared was   24    : It belonged to me and would always be mine   25    anything going on outside of me. I wasn't quite sure what my journey would involve, but I was   26    who would be at the other end. I steeled myself to travel the road that would lead me to a better understanding of who I was and of what I wanted out of life. I shared my mixed feelings with my husband.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            When I was in 7th grade, I had a lot of trouble reading. My mother used to sit by my side, and explain each paragraph of each school reading assignment to me because I didn't understand what I was reading. She would have to read each paragraph to me, and then after each paragraph, she summarized what we just read.
            In class, I tried to hide the fact that I couldn't read. My teachers gave us the last 10 minutes of class to start our reading homework, and I would sit there for the last ten minutes of class staring at the page, pretending I was reading it ― I remember a terrible feeling of not wanting to get in trouble for not being able to comprehend. I had to wait until I got home so my mother could explain it to me. How did I ever get into Cornell University? By eighth grade I started understanding a little on my own, but I was reading at an incredibly slow rate. In eighth grade, I got hold of all the speed reading books I could get my hands on. I read them all very slowly at the time. I even went out and took a course on speed reading. Then I developed my own system which was easier and produced quicker results. I started practicing these techniques every day, and as I started to read faster, my understanding increased. I found that I stopped daydreaming and thinking about other things while I was reading, and started getting the larger meaning. I was reading faster and comprehending better.
            I found that when you read slowly, word by word, you get lost in the words, lose the bigger picture, and your comprehension drops. When you read faster, your concentration actually increases and your comprehension goes up because instead of getting lost in the words, you see the overall picture.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Elizabeth's father died when she was nine. Her family was large, and very poor. She struggled for self esteem, but it was difficult when her clothes weren't as nice as the other kids and her new school was still unfamiliar.
            During a math lesson, Elizabeth stared at the chalkboard and was struggling to understand a concept. With every stroke of the chalk, she became more confused. She had suffered from chronic ear infections (感染), and had missed many days of her fifth grade year. When she finally got the courage to raise her little hand and ask Mr. Thompson how the problem was done, he became very angry. He marched her up in front of the class and told this insecure child that she was "incapable of learning and extremely stupid."
            This remark plagued (使…困扰) Elizabeth for years.
            Elizabeth drifted into marriage. After discovering her husband's long time infidelity (不忠), she found herself divorced with three young daughters. She moved back to her home state and tried to pick up the pieces she had left behind.
            Knowing that she would be the sole support of these children, and having no desire to remarry, Elizabeth started college. Like most good mothers, she wanted the best for her children. She didn't want to deprive them of their mother. She would rise early and stay up late to get every spare minute she could to study.
            When she received her first "A" she was confused. She thought there must be some mistake. This was Elizabeth, Elizabeth the stupid. When her good grades piled up, she realized for the first time that maybe Mr. Thompson was wrong. She graduated from Brigham Young University, and will soon be receiving her master's degree at California State University in San Bernardino.



    36.

    A) she had ear infections and could not hear very well  
    B) she was still overwhelmed by the death of her father  
    C) too much homework had made her tired and sick

    正确答案： B
