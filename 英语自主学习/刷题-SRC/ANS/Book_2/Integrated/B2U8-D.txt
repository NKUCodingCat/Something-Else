    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            When school was out, I hurried to find my sister and get out of the schoolyard before seeing anybody in my class. But Barbara and her friends had beaten us to the playground entrance and they seemed to be waiting for us. Barbara said, "So now you're in the A class." She sounded impressed. "What's the A class?" I asked. Everybody made superior yet faintly envious giggling sounds. "Well, why did you think the teacher moved you to the front of the room, dopey? Didn't you know you were in the C class before, way in the back of the room?"     　　
            Of course I hadn't known. The Wenatchee fifth grade was bigger than my whole school which had been in North Dakota, and the idea of subdivisions within a grade had never occurred to me. The subdividing for the first marking period had been done before I came to the school, and l had never, in the six weeks when I'd been there, talked to anyone long enough to find out about the A, B, and C classes.     　　
            I still could not understand why that had made such a difference to Barbara and her friends. I didn’t yet know that it was shameful and dirty to be a transient laborer and ridiculous to be from North Dakota. I thought living in a tent was more fun than living in a house.     　　
            I didn't know that we were gypsies, really (how that thought would have excited me then! ). It didn't occur to me that we were all looked upon as one more of the untrustworthy natural phenomena, drifting here and there like mists or winds, I didn't know that I was the only child who had camped on the Baumann's land ever to get out of the C class.    　　
            I only knew that for two happy days I walked to school with Barbara and her friends, played hopscotch and jumped rope with them at class intervals, and was even invited into the house for some ginger ale ― a strange drink I had never tasted before.



    31.

    A) reflective  
    B) enthusiastic  
    C) impersonal

    C) the marking system confused her  
    D) all children of transient laborers were placed in the C class  

    正确答案： D
    33.

    正确答案： B
    35.
    	
    Immediately after the narrator was moved to the A class, what was the attitude of Barbara and Barbara's friends towards her?
    A) Dislike.  
    B) Acceptance.  
    C) Apology.  
    D) Jealousy.  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            "The world's environment is surprisingly healthy. Discuss." If that were an examination topic, most students would tear it apart, offering a long list of complaints: from local smog to global climate change, from the felling of forests to the extinction of species. Yet the students who should be given the highest marks would actually be those who agreed with the statement. The surprise is how good things are, not how bad.
            After all, the world's population has more than tripled during this century, and world output has risen hugely, so you would expect the earth itself to have been affected. Indeed, if people lived, consumed and produced things in the same way as they did in 1900(or 1950, or indeed 1980), the world by now would be a pretty disgusting place: smelly, dirty, toxic and dangerous.
            But they don't. The reasons why they don't, and why the environment has not been ruined, have to do with prices, technological innovation, social change and government regulation in response to popular pressure. That is why today's environmental problems in the poor countries ought, in principle, to be solvable.
            Raw materials have not run out, and show no sign of doing so. What has happened is that every time a material seems to be running short, the price has risen and, in response, people have looked for new sources of supply, tried to find ways to use less of the material, or looked for a new substitute. For this reason prices for food fluctuate, in response to harvests, natural disasters and political instability; and when they rise, it takes some time before new sources of supply become available. But they always do, assisted by new farming and crop technology. The long term trend has been downwards.
            It is where prices and markets do not operate properly that this benign trend begins to stumble, and the genuine problems arise. Markets cannot always keep the environment healthy. If no one owns the resource concerned, no one has an interest in conserving it or fostering it: fish is the best example of this.



    36.
    	
    According to the author, most students_______.
    A) believe the world's environment is in an undesirable condition  
    B) agree that the environment of the world is not as bad as it is thought to be  
    C) get high marks for their good knowledge of the world's environment  
    D) appear somewhat unconcerned about the state of the world's environment  

    正确答案： A
    37.

    A) has made the world a worse place to live in  
    B) has had a positive influence on the environment  
    C) has not significantly affected the environment  
    D) has made the world a dangerous place to live in  

    正确答案： C
    38.
    	
    One of the reasons why the long-term trend of prices has been downwards is that _____.
    A) technological innovation can promote social stability  
    B) political instability will cause consumption to drop  
    C) new farming and crop technology can lead to overproduction  
    D) new sources are always becoming available
