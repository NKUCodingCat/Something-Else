            But while I was feeling uneasy about the bridge I'd just   21    , I also began to feel a renewed sense of hopefulness about the   22    on the other side. I had had a long love affair with the written word that was   23    and apart from any of my roles. What we shared was   24    : It belonged to me and would always be mine   25    anything going on outside of me. I wasn't quite sure what my journey would involve, but I was   26    who would be at the other end. I steeled myself to travel the road that would lead me to a better understanding of who I was and of what I wanted out of life. I shared my mixed feelings with my husband.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            When I was in 7th grade, I had a lot of trouble reading. My mother used to sit by my side, and explain each paragraph of each school reading assignment to me because I didn't understand what I was reading. She would have to read each paragraph to me, and then after each paragraph, she summarized what we just read.
            In class, I tried to hide the fact that I couldn't read. My teachers gave us the last 10 minutes of class to start our reading homework, and I would sit there for the last ten minutes of class staring at the page, pretending I was reading it ― I remember a terrible feeling of not wanting to get in trouble for not being able to comprehend. I had to wait until I got home so my mother could explain it to me. How did I ever get into Cornell University? By eighth grade I started understanding a little on my own, but I was reading at an incredibly slow rate. In eighth grade, I got hold of all the speed reading books I could get my hands on. I read them all very slowly at the time. I even went out and took a course on speed reading. Then I developed my own system which was easier and produced quicker results. I started practicing these techniques every day, and as I started to read faster, my understanding increased. I found that I stopped daydreaming and thinking about other things while I was reading, and started getting the larger meaning. I was reading faster and comprehending better.
            I found that when you read slowly, word by word, you get lost in the words, lose the bigger picture, and your comprehension drops. When you read faster, your concentration actually increases and your comprehension goes up because instead of getting lost in the words, you see the overall picture.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            More and more Americans are finding that they must learn to cope with chronic illness. Granted, for some of the 125 million people with chronic illnesses, the problems are minor, but for 60 million others have multiple chronic conditions that can be serious or life-threatening.
            The toll of so much illness is enormous ― $510 billion annually. But chronic illness exacts an emotional toll as well, and it is in that realm that researchers are increasingly looking to the hard-won wisdom of patients to find ways to help others cope with diseases that might once have engulfed them in shame or despair.
            One view is that people with chronic illnesses should be neither pitied nor idealized, either by others or by themselves. Pity can come across as condescending. Turning someone into a hero may not help. Other mental health specialists, such as Ann Webster, take a somewhat different view. Some people with chronic illnesses do want to be seen as normal, she said, but others do seem truly heroic and may appreciate some recognition of that. "A lot of people grow and change in profound ways", Webster said. Some long-term survivors in her AIDS group "have changed and grown and turned into some of the most evolved and spiritual people, and they never were that way before." "It's really hard having a chronic illness, and knowing it is changing your life and your future," she said. Some people can throw their energies into beating their disease and returning to normal activities. But others can't beat the illness, no matter how hard they try. Many people can do this on their own, she said, but many also find it helpful to join support groups or see individual counselors. Ultimately, the task is to make meaning in the face of disability or imminent（即将发生的，逼近的） death, to reassess what's still important and what you can still do, when your old goals and dreams can no longer be met.



    36.
    	
    Ann Webster is different from other people in that she thinks ______.
    A) people with chronic diseases may feel encouraged when their heroic deeds are recognized  
    B) people with chronic illnesses wish to be treated in the same way as a normal person  
    C) idealizing people with chronic illnesses may put them under great mental pressure  
    D) sympathizing people with chronic illnesses may make them feel inferior to others  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    Which of the following is NOT TRUE of the people in Webster's group?
    A) Many people turn to support groups for help.  
    B) Most of them realize they have to fight on their own.  
    C) Some of them return to normal life by fighting hard.  
    D) Some of them fail no matter how hard they try.  

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    We may infer from the passage that the author most probably agrees to the opinion that _____.
    A) people should stick to their dreams and goals no matter what happens  
    B) people should keep fighting against diseases and turn themselves into heroes  
    C) people should make their life meaningful by resetting goals when necessary  
    D) people should never give up fighting so long as there is still hope  

    正确答案： C
    39.
