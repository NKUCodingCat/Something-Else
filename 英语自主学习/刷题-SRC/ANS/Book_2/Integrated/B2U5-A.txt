    Script:         Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should die tomorrow. Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life. We should live each day with gentleness, vigor, and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost when time stretches before us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come. There are those who, of course, who would adopt the epicurean (享乐者) motto of "Eat, drink, and be merry," but most people would be chastened (磨练) by the certainty of impendent death. It has often been noted that those who live, or have lived, in the shadow of death bring a mellow sweetness to everything they do. Most of us, however, take life for granted. We know that one day we must die, but usually we picture that day as far in the future. When we are in buoyant (乐观的) health, death is all but unimaginable. We seldom think of it. The days stretch out in an endless vista. So we go about petty tasks, hardly aware of our listless attitude toward life.

    正确答案： emphasize

    正确答案： vigor

    正确答案： appreciation

    正确答案： constant

    正确答案： motto

    正确答案： impendent

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Pronouncing a language is a skill. Every normal person is expert in the skill of pronouncing his own language; but few people are even moderately proficient in pronouncing foreign languages. Now there are many reasons for this, some obvious, some perhaps not so obvious. But I suggest that the fundamental reason why people in general do not speak foreign languages much better than they do is that they fail to grasp the true nature of the problem of learning to pronounce, and consequently never set about tackling it in the right way. Far too many people fail to realize that pronouncing a foreign language is a skill ― one that needs careful training of a special kind, and one that cannot be acquired by just leaving it to take care of itself. I think even teachers of language, while recognizing the importance of good accent, tend to neglect, in their practical teaching, the branch of study concerned with speaking the language. So the first point I want to make is that English pronunciation must be taught; the teacher should be prepared to devote some of the lesson time to this, and his whole attitude to the subject should get the student to feel that there is a matter worthy of receiving his close attention. So, there should be occasions when other aspects of English, such as grammar or spelling, are allowed for the moment to take second place.
            Apart from the question of the time given to pronunciation, there are two other requirements for the teacher: the first, knowledge; the second, technique.
            It is important that the teacher should be in possession of the necessary information. This can generally be obtained from books. It is possible to get from books some ideas of the mechanics of speech, and of what we call general phonetic theory. It is also possible in this way to get a clear mental picture of the relationship between the sounds of different languages, between the speech habits of English people and those, say, of your students. Unless the teacher has such a picture, any comments he makes on his students' pronunciation are unlikely to be of much use, and lesson time spent on pronunciation may well be time wasted.



    31.
    	
    What does the author actually say about pronouncing foreign languages?
    A) There aren't many people who are even fairly good at it.  
    B) Only a few people are really proficient.  
    C) No one is really an expert in the skill.  
    D) There are even some people who are moderately proficient.  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    The author argues that going about the problem of pronunciation in the wrong way is __________.
    A) an obvious cause of not grasping the problem correctly  
    B) a consequence of not grasping the problem correctly  
    C) a fundamental consequence of not speaking well  
    D) not an obvious cause of speaking poorly  

    正确答案： C
    33.
    	
    The best way of learning to speak a foreign language, the author suggests, is by ___________.
    A) picking it up naturally as a child  
    B) learning from a native speaker  
    C) undertaking systematic work  
    D) not concentrating on pronunciation much  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    The value the student puts on correct speech habits depends on _________.
    A) how closely he attends to the matter  
    B) whether it is English that is being taught  
    C) his teacher's approach to pronunciation  
    D) the importance normally given to grammar and spelling  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    How might the teacher find himself wasting lesson time?
    A) By making ill-informed comments upon pronunciation.  
    B) By spending lesson time on pronunciation.  
    C) By not using books on phonetics in the classroom.  
    D) By not giving students a clear mental picture of the differences between sounds.  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            In the world of entertainment, TV talk shows have undoubtedly flooded every inch of space on daytime television. And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one varies in style and format. But no two shows are more profoundly opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows. Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of "trash talk (废话)". The topics on his show are as shocking as shocking can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show themes of love, sex, cheating, guilt, hate, conflict and morality to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is a display and exploitation of society's moral catastrophes (灾难), yet people are willing to eat up the intriguing predicaments (困境) of other people's lives. Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its extreme, but Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show focuses on the improvement of society and an individual's quality of life. Topics range from teaching your children responsibility, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.
            Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being dumped on society. Jerry ends every show with a "final word". He makes a small speech that sums up the entire moral of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.
            Clean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main target audience are middle-class Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and stability to deal with life's tougher problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of an association with the young adults of society. These are 18- to 21-year-olds whose main troubles in life involve love, relationship, sex, money and peers. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned underneath the show's exploitation.
            While the two shows are as different as night and day, both have ruled the talk show circuit for many years now. Each one caters to a different audience while both have a strong following from large groups of fans. Ironically, both could also be considered pioneers in the talk show world.



    36.
    	
    Compared with other TV talk shows, both the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey are __________.
    A) more family-oriented  
    B) unusually popular  
    C) more profound  
    D) relatively formal  

    正确答案： C
    37.

    A) remain fascinated by them  
    B) are ready to face up to them  
    C) remain indifferent to them  
    D) are willing to get involved in them  

    正确答案： A
    38.

    A) ironical  
    B) sensitive  
    C) instructive
