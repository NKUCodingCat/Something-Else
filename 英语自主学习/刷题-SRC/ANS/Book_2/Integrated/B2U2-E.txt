            But I'm happy to live without one. In fact, not being focused on   21    goods feels quite natural to me. There are many people   22    who would consider my lifestyle to be   23    .

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            A value could be defined as a belief or attitude you hold close or something that you want to keep as a standard for judging yourself and the rest of the world. It is the basis for your sense of right and wrong, good and bad.
            It is our values that drive us to act in certain ways, to lead a certain lifestyle and to shun certain habits. For instance, if you truly believe that drinking alcohol is not a good thing, you will not drink. And if you do, you will probably feel guilty and regret it later.
            Each of us has a unique value system ― almost as unique as our fingerprints. A value system is not just something that is passed down from parents or learnt through behavior in schools, etc. It is developed through personal experiences, in combination with the values that our immediate society lends to us.
            Yet, value systems can differ dramatically even within the same family or group of friends. For instance, your parents may think it is wrong to marry out of your own culture or community, while your brother may not believe in marriage at all.
            Similarly, you may not like lying to your parents, but your best friend may think it is just another way of making life easier.
            Values can be related to health, cultural awareness, religion, preservation of nature, loyalty, wealth, creativity, independence, search for fame or peace, education, and much more.
            Any combination of these separate values will form a person's values system. To figure out yours, you must do a lot of soul-searching, and ask yourself questions about what really matters to you and what you deeply believe in, or what are the issues that you are not willing to compromise on ― that will be your unique set of values.

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Social change is more likely to occur in societies where there is a mixture of different kinds of people than in societies where people are similar in many ways. The simple reason for this is that there are more different ways of looking at things present in the first kind of society. There are more ideas, more interest, and more groups and organizations with different beliefs. In addition, there is usually a greater worldly interest and greater tolerance in mixed societies. All these factors tend to promote social change by opening more areas of life to decision. In a society where people are quite similar in many ways, there are fewer occasions for people to see the need or the opportunity for change because everything seems to be the same. And although conditions may not be satisfactory, they are at least customary and undisputed.
            Within a society, social change is also likely to occur more frequently and more readily in the material aspects of the culture than in the non-material, for example, in technology rather than in values; in what has been learned later in life rather than what was learned early; in the less basic and less emotional aspects of society than in their opposite; in the simple elements rather than in the complex ones; in form rather than in substance; and in elements that are acceptable to the culture rather than in strange elements.
            What’s more, social change is easier if it is gradual. For example, it comes more readily in human relations on a continuous scale rather than one with violent changes. This is one reason why change has not come more quickly to Black Americans as compared to other American minorities, because of the sharp difference in appearance between them and their white counterparts(对应的人).

    The following factors tend to promote social change EXCEPT ________________.
    A) different kinds of people  
    B) different points of view

    B) quicker adaptation to changing circumstances  
    C) greater willingness to change  
    D) greater readiness to agree to different opinions and ideas  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE within a society?
    A) Social change is less likely to occur in technology than in values.  
    B) What people learned in their early times tends to change quickly.  
    C) The basic and emotional aspects of society tend to slow down social change.
