            Near the end of the year, when I put on the Salvation Army's red apron, something changes inside me. Instead of feeling out of   21    economically, I begin to feel a genuine sense of belonging. As I   22    my bell, people stop to share their personal stories of how much it meant to be helped when they were going through a   23    time. People helping people is something I feel deeply connected to. While I'm ringing the bell,   24    strangers have brought me hot chocolate, leaving me with a lingering smile. Countless   25    have helped to keep me warm with the   26    of the season: "Thank you for ringing on such a cold day." "Can I get you a cup of coffee?" "Bless you for your good work." December is the time of year I feel   27    .
            Over the past four years, I've grown to understand more about myself because of a single question from a   28    child. As I've examined what it means to be poor, it has become clear to me what I am most   29    for: both my tangible and my intangible good   30    .

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            The first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the United States. It was a small coffee shop that roasted its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three more Starbucks stores in Seattle.
            Things really began to change for the company in 1981. That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who ran Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, and he was curious about the company. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did, and he liked what he saw. He wanted to become part of the company. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing.
            In 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The unique atmosphere of the coffee bars there caught his eye. To Schultz it seemed that Italians spent their daily lives in three places: home, work, and coffee bars. His experience in Italy gave him a new idea for Starbucks back in Seattle.
            Schultz created an atmosphere for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Between 1987 and 1992, Starbucks opened 150 new stores ― and that was only the beginning. In fact, by the year 2000, three new Starbucks stores opened somewhere around the world every day!
            Today, Starbucks has thousands of stores, including stores in twenty-six countries. One thing that helps make Starbucks succeed in cities outside the United States is the way Starbucks works with local stores and restaurants. By working together with a store already in the city, Starbucks gets an understanding of customers in the city. This understanding helps Starbucks open stores in the right locations for their customers.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Social change is more likely to occur in societies where there is a mixture of different kinds of people than in societies where people are similar in many ways. The simple reason for this is that there are more different ways of looking at things present in the first kind of society. There are more ideas, more interest, and more groups and organizations with different beliefs. In addition, there is usually a greater worldly interest and greater tolerance in mixed societies. All these factors tend to promote social change by opening more areas of life to decision. In a society where people are quite similar in many ways, there are fewer occasions for people to see the need or the opportunity for change because everything seems to be the same. And although conditions may not be satisfactory, they are at least customary and undisputed.
            Within a society, social change is also likely to occur more frequently and more readily in the material aspects of the culture than in the non-material, for example, in technology rather than in values; in what has been learned later in life rather than what was learned early; in the less basic and less emotional aspects of society than in their opposite; in the simple elements rather than in the complex ones; in form rather than in substance; and in elements that are acceptable to the culture rather than in strange elements.
            What’s more, social change is easier if it is gradual. For example, it comes more readily in human relations on a continuous scale rather than one with violent changes. This is one reason why change has not come more quickly to Black Americans as compared to other American minorities, because of the sharp difference in appearance between them and their white counterparts(对应的人).



    36.
    	
    The following factors tend to promote social change EXCEPT ________________.
    A) different kinds of people  
    B) different points of view  
    C) different interests  
    D) different conditions  

    正确答案： D
    37.

    A) more respect for different beliefs and behaviors  
    B) quicker adaptation to changing circumstances  
    C) greater willingness to change  
    D) greater readiness to agree to different opinions and ideas  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE within a society?
    A) Social change is less likely to occur in technology than in values.  
    B) What people learned in their early times tends to change quickly.  
    C) The basic and emotional aspects of society tend to slow down social change.  
    D) Strange elements are likely to quicken social change.  

    正确答案： C
    39.

    B) among Black Americans  
    C) between Black Americans and their white counterparts
