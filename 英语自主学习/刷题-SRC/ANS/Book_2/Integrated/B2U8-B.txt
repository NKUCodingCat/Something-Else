    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            "The world's environment is surprisingly healthy. Discuss." If that were an examination topic, most students would tear it apart, offering a long list of complaints: from local smog to global climate change, from the felling of forests to the extinction of species. Yet the students who should be given the highest marks would actually be those who agreed with the statement. The surprise is how good things are, not how bad.
            After all, the world's population has more than tripled during this century, and world output has risen hugely, so you would expect the earth itself to have been affected. Indeed, if people lived, consumed and produced things in the same way as they did in 1900(or 1950, or indeed 1980), the world by now would be a pretty disgusting place: smelly, dirty, toxic and dangerous.
            But they don't. The reasons why they don't, and why the environment has not been ruined, have to do with prices, technological innovation, social change and government regulation in response to popular pressure. That is why today's environmental problems in the poor countries ought, in principle, to be solvable.
            Raw materials have not run out, and show no sign of doing so. What has happened is that every time a material seems to be running short, the price has risen and, in response, people have looked for new sources of supply, tried to find ways to use less of the material, or looked for a new substitute. For this reason prices for food fluctuate, in response to harvests, natural disasters and political instability; and when they rise, it takes some time before new sources of supply become available. But they always do, assisted by new farming and crop technology. The long term trend has been downwards.
            It is where prices and markets do not operate properly that this benign trend begins to stumble, and the genuine problems arise. Markets cannot always keep the environment healthy. If no one owns the resource concerned, no one has an interest in conserving it or fostering it: fish is the best example of this.



    31.
    	
    According to the author, most students_______.
    A) believe the world's environment is in an undesirable condition  
    B) agree that the environment of the world is not as bad as it is thought to be  
    C) get high marks for their good knowledge of the world's environment  
    D) appear somewhat unconcerned about the state of the world's environment  

    正确答案： A
    32.

    A) has made the world a worse place to live in  
    B) has had a positive influence on the environment  
    C) has not significantly affected the environment  
    D) has made the world a dangerous place to live in  

    正确答案： C
    33.
    	
    One of the reasons why the long-term trend of prices has been downwards is that _____.
    A) technological innovation can promote social stability  
    B) political instability will cause consumption to drop  
    C) new farming and crop technology can lead to overproduction  
    D) new sources are always becoming available  

    正确答案： D
    34.
    	
    Fish resources are diminishing because_______.
    A) no new substitutes can be found in large quantities  
    B) they are not owned by any particular entity  
    C) improper methods of fishing have ruined the fishing grounds  
    D) water pollution is extremely serious  

    正确答案： B
    35.
    	
    The primary solution to environmental problems is_______.
    A) to allow market forces to operate properly  
    B) to curb consumption of natural resources  
    C) to limit the growth of the world population  
    D) to avoid fluctuations in prices  

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            More and more, the operations of our business, governments, and financial institutions are controlled by information that exists only inside computer memories. Anyone clever enough to modify this information for his own purposes can reap substantial rewards. Even worse, a number of people who have done this and been caught at it have managed to get away without punishment.     　　
            It's easy for computer crimes to go undetected if no one checks up on what the computer is doing, but even if the crime is detected, the criminal may walk away not only unpunished but with a glowing recommendation from his former employers. Of course, we have no statistics on crimes that go undetected. But it's disturbing to note how many of the crimes we do know about were detected by accident, not by systematic inspections or other security procedures. The computer criminals who have been caught may have been the victims of uncommonly bad luck. 　　
            For example, a certain keypunch operator complained of having to stay overtime to punch extra cards. Investigation revealed that the extra cards she was being asked to punch were for dishonest transactions. In another case, dissatisfied employees of the thief tipped off the company that was being robbed. Unlike other lawbreakers, who must leave the country, commit suicide, or go to jail, computer criminals sometimes escape punishment, demanding not only that they not be charged but that they be given good recommendations and perhaps other benefits. All too often, their demands have been met.     　
            Why? Because company executives are afraid of the bad publicity that would result if the public found out their computer had been misused.
            They hesitate at the thought of a criminal boasting in open court of how he juggled the most confidential records right under the noses of the company's executives, accountants, and security staff. And so another computer criminal departs with just the recommendations he needs to continue his crimes elsewhere.



    36.
    	
    It can be concluded from the passage that _______.
    A) it is still impossible to detect computer crimes today  
    B) computer crimes are one of most serious problems in the operation of the financial institutions  
    C) computer criminals can escape punishment because they can't be detected  
    D) people commit computer crimes at the request of their company  

    正确答案： B
    37.
    	
    It is implied in the third paragraph that _______.
    A) more computer crimes go undetected than are discovered  
    B) the rapid increase of computer crimes is a troublesome problem  
    C) most computer criminals are smart enough to cover up their crimes  
    D) most computer criminals who are caught blame their bad luck  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    Which of the following is mentioned in the passage?
    A) A strict law against computer crimes must be enforced.  
    B) Companies need to impose restrictions on confidential information.  
    C) Companies will guard against computer crimes to protect their reputation.  
    D) Companies usually hesitate to uncover computer crimes.  

    正确答案： D
    39.
    	
    The underlying reason for the computer criminals to get recommendations he needs is that _______.
    A) they have skills formidably difficult for others to master  
    B) the employers are afraid that they would take avenge if punished  
    C) the employers are much afraid of bringing the public into disbelief towards them through the criminals' words in open court  
    D) those who commit crimes do not mean bad  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    What may happen to computer criminals once they are caught?
    A) With bad reputation they can hardly find another job.  
    B) They will be denied access to confidential records.  
    C) They may walk away and easily find another job.  
    D) They must leave the country or go to jail.
