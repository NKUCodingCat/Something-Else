            The tolerance for change also represents deeply rooted ideas of freedom. Danish scholar Otto Jespersen wrote in 1905, "The English language would not have been what it is if the English had not been for centuries great respecters of the   21    of each individual and if everybody had not been free to   22    new paths for himself."
            I like that idea. Consider that the same cultural   23    producing the English language also   24    the great principles of freedom and rights of man in the   25    world. The first shoots   26    in England, and they grew stronger in America. The English-speaking peoples have defeated all efforts to build   27    around their language.
            Indeed, the English language is not the special   28    of grammarians, language police, teachers, writers or the intellectual   29    . English is, and always has been, the   30    of common man.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            If you ask people to name one person who had the greatest effect on the English language, you will get answers like "Shakespeare", "Samuel Johnson" and "Webster" but none of these men had any effect at all compared with a man who didn't even speak English ― William the Conqueror.
            Before 1066, in the land we now call Great Britain lived people belonging to two major language groups. In the west-central region lived the Welsh, who spoke a Celtic language, and in north lived the Scots, whose language, though not the same as Welsh, was also Celtic. In the rest of the country lived the Saxons, actually a mixture of Anglos-Saxons, and other Germanic and Nordic peoples, who spoke what we call Anglo-Saxon (or Old English), a Germanic Language. If this state of affairs had lasted, English today would be close to German.
    　　But this state of affairs did not last. In 1066 the Normans led by William defeated the Saxons and began their rule over England. For about a century, French became the official language of England while Old English became the language of peasants. As a result, English words of politics and the law come from French rather than German. In some cases, modern English even shows a distinction between upper-class French and lower-class Anglo-Saxon in its words. We even have different words for some foods, meat in particular, depending on whether it is still out in fields or at home ready to be cooked, which shows the fact that the Saxon peasants were doing the farming, while the upper-class Normans were doing most of the eating.
            When Americans visit Europe for the first time, they usually find Germany more "foreign" than France because the German they see on signs and advertisements seems much more different from English than French does. Few realize that the English language is actually Germanic in its beginning and that the French influences are all the result of one man's ambition.

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Napoleon Bonaparte was keen to learn English while in exile (流放), documents shown in Britain for the first time reveal.
            The deposed French emperor apparently wanted to learn the language of his foes so he could read what the London papers were writing about him. Scraps of paper from his English lessons in captivity on the island of St Helena go on show at London's National Maritime Museum on Thursday. They include lines of French haltingly translated by Napoleon into English.
            Count Emmanuel de las Cases, who accompanied the emperor into exile after he surrendered to the English at the Battle of Waterloo, wrote about his desire to learn the language in his memoirs (论文集). According to him, Napoleon had his first lesson on 17 January 1816, when he asked las Cases to dictate to him some sentences in French, which he then translated, using a table of auxiliary verbs and a dictionary.
            According to historian Dr Peter Hicks, las Cases describes how Napoleon hated being sat down to work like a schoolboy but steeled himself for the task. Dr Hicks said: "He was not necessarily anti-English. He had to fight because it was the enemy of France." He added: "In France people are amazed to find that he was learning English. But he didn't do it for pleasure. He wondered how much money he could have saved in translation if he could have learnt English."
            The documents are to feature in the Greenwich museum's Nelson and Napoleon exhibition, being held to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar. They are among a wide range of letters, paintings, personal items and objects lent by galleries and museums across Europe. The English lesson papers, described by Dr Hicks as quite remarkable, are on loan from the Foundation Napoleon in Paris.



    36.
    	
    What evidence shows that Napoleon liked to learn English?
    A) Documents displayed in Greenwich museum.  
    B) Scraps of paper from his English lessons.  
    C) A person who accompanied him said that.  
    D) All the above.  

    正确答案： D
    37.

    A) he was very concerned about British’s opinion about him  
    B) he just learned it for fun  
    C) it could save him a lot of money in translation  
    D) it helped him pass the time in exile  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    What is Napoleon's actual attitude towards Britain?
