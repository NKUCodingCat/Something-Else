            I'd never realized how important daily routine is: dressing for work, sleeping normal hours. I'd never thought I relied so much on co-workers for company. I began to understand why long-term unemployment can be so   21    , why life without an externally supported daily plan can   22    to higher rates of drug   23    , crime, suicide.
            To   24    balance to my life, I force myself back into the   25    world. I call people, arrange to meet with the few remaining friends who haven't fled New York City. I try to   26    get to the gym, so as to set apart the weekend from the rest of my week. I   27    interviews for stories, doctor's appointments ― anything to get me   28    the house and connected with others.
            But sometimes being face to face is too much. I see a friend and her ringing laughter is   29    ― the noise of conversation in the restaurant, unbearable. I make my excuses and   30    . I re-enter my apartment and run to the computer as though it were a place of safety.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            If you want to stay young, sit down and have a good think.
            This is the research findings of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon. Professor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down. With a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations. Computer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect (智能) and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, doesn't contact with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties).
            Contraction of front and side parts ― as cells die off ― was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty and seventy-year-olds.
            Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age ― using the head.
            The findings show in general terms that contraction of brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine works in government offices are, however, likely to have shrinking brains as the farm workers, bus drivers and shop assistants.
            Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must circulate properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. "The best way to maintain good blood circulation is through using the brain," he says, "Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't rely on pocket calculations."



    31.

    A) why certain people aged sooner than others

    D) The latest development of computer technology.

    A) our brains shrink as we grow older  
    B) the front section of the brain doesn't shrink

    C) Clerks.  
    D) Shop assistants.  

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            It is hardly necessary for me to cite all the evidence of the depressing state of literacy. These figures from the Department of Education are sufficient: 27 million Americans cannot read at all, and a further 35 million read at a level that is less than sufficient to survive in our society.
            But my own worry today is less that of the overwhelming problem of elemental literacy than it is of the slightly more luxurious problem of the decline in the skill even of the middle-class reader, of his unwillingness to afford those spaces of silence, those luxuries of domesticity and time and concentration, that surround the image of the classic act of reading. It has been suggested that almost 80 percent of America's literate, educated teenagers can no longer read without an accompanying noise (music) in the background or a television screen flickering at the corner of their field of perception. We know very little about the brain and how it deals with simultaneous conflicting input, but every common-sense intuition suggests we should be profoundly alarmed. This violation of concentration, silence, solitude goes to the very heart of our notion of literacy, this new form of part-reading, of part-perception against background distraction, renders impossible certain essential acts of apprehension and concentration, let alone that most important tribute any human being can pay to a poem or a piece of prose he or she really loves, which is to learn it by heart. Not by brain, by heart; the expression is vital.
            Under these circumstances, the question of what future there is for the arts of reading is a real one. Ahead of us lie technical, psychic, and social transformations probably much more dramatic than those brought about by Gutenberg, the German inventor in printing. The Gutenberg revolution, as we now know it, took a long time; its effects are still being debated. The information revolution will touch every facet of composition, publication, distribution, and reading. No one in the book industry can say with any confidence what will happen to the book as we've known it.



    36.
    	
    The picture of the reading ability of the American people, drawn by the author, is _______.
