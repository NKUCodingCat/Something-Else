    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            If you know exactly what you want, the best route to a job is to get specialized training. A recent survey shows that companies like graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training.
            That's especially true of booming fields that are challenging for workers. At Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, for example, bachelor's degree graduates get an average of four or five job offers with salaries ranging from the high teens to the low 20s and plenty of chances for rapid advancement. Large companies, especially, like a background of formal education coupled with work experience.
            But in the long run, too much specialization doesn't pay off. Business, which has been flooded with MBAs, no longer considers the degree an automatic stamp of approval. The MBA may open doors and command a higher salary initially, but the impact of a degree washes out after five years.
            As further evidence of the erosion (销蚀) of corporate (公司的) faith in specialized degrees, Michigan State Scheetz cites a pattern in corporate hiring practices, although companies tend to take on specialists as new hires, they often seek out generalists for middle and upper-level management. "They want someone who isn't constrained (限制) by nuts and bolts to look at the big picture", says Scheetz.
            This sounds suspiciously like a formal statement that you approve of the liberal-arts graduate. Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have: writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems, David Birch claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, "I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things," says Birch. Liberal-arts mean an academically thorough and strict program that includes literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior ― plus a computer course or two. With that under your belt, you can feel free to specialize, "A liberal-arts degree coupled with an MBA or some other technical training is a very good combination in the marketplace," says Scheetz.



    31.
    	
    What can we infer from the example in Para. 2?
    A) All of graduates get an average of four or five job offers.  
    B) Most of the graduates have chances for quick promotion.

    According to Para. 3, we can infer that ________.
    A) MBA programs will be as popular in five years’ time as they are now  
    B) in the long run, most specialization can insist people to get a brighter future  
    C) an MBA degree will fail to help promotion to managerial positions after five years  
    D) people will not pay attention to the degree of MBA

    B) liberal-arts people are more capable of handling changing situations  
    C) liberal-arts people must have attended MBA programs  
    D) liberal-arts people are completely trained in specialized fields

    B) Job training is more important than formal schooling.  
    C) The author thinks that generalists will outdo specialists in management.  
    D) On-the-job training is less costly than education.  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            A recent study, published in last week’s Journal of the American Medical Association, offers a picture of how risky it is to get a lift from a teenage driver. Indeed, a 16-year-old driver with three or more passengers is three times as likely to have a fatal accident as a teenager driving alone. By contrast, the risk of death for drivers between 30 and 59 decreases with each additional passenger.
            The authors also found that the death rates for teenage drivers increased dramatically after 10 p.m., and especially after midnight, with passengers in the car, the driver was even more likely to die in a late-night accident.
            Robert Foss, a scientist at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center, says the higher death rates for teenage drivers have less to do with "really stupid behavior" than with just a lack of driving experience. "The basic issue," he says, "is that adults who are responsible for issuing licenses fail to recognize how complex and skilled a task driving is."
            Both he and the authors of the study believe that the way to mitigate the problem is to have states institute so-called graduated licensing systems, in which getting a license is a multistage process. A graduated license requires that a teenager first prove himself capable of driving in the presence of an adult, followed by a period of driving with night of passenger restrictions, before graduating to full driving privileges.
            Graduated licensing systems have reduced teenage driver crashes, according to recent studies. About half of the states now have some sort of graduated licensing system in place, but only 10 of those states have restrictions on passengers, California is the strictest, with a novice (新手) driver prohibited from carrying any passenger under 20 (without the presence of an adult over 25) for the first six months.

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    According to the passage, which of the following statements is NOT TRUE?
    A) The high death rate of teenage drivers is mainly due to lack of driving experience.  
    B) The licensing authorities are partly responsible for the teenagers' driving accidents.  
    C) Graduated licensing systems have reduced teenage driver crashes.  
    D) Driving is a skill too complicated for teenagers to learn.  

    正确答案： D
    39.
