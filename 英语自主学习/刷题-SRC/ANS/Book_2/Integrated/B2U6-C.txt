    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Holidays usually help us remember what irritates us most about family.
            The husband who waits until the last minute to shop. The children who poison cherished family time with bad tempers. The sister-in-law who criticizes the father who complains.
            This is also the time of year when we are together with people with whom we have long-time conflicts. The black mood that spoils holiday gatherings is a result of having three or four generations under one roof. There is tremendous conflict of values, and you can't negotiate values.
            The result: Everybody gets their hot buttons pushed, and emotions explode.
    These hot buttons have familiar labels.
    ― Minimizing: "It's not that big a deal."
    ― Degrading: "You are just a kid; what do you know?"
    ― Blaming: "You always ― "
    ― Comparing: "You are just your father."
    ― Judging: "That's the silliest idea I ever heard."
    ― Name-calling: "You are being ridiculous."
    ― And dictating: "I know better. Do it my way."
            These are the top 10 hot buttons, and during the holidays they get pushed over and over. You even know who is going to say what and when.
            Nobody wants a blow-up on a holiday, so we ignore and ignore. But those disagreements stay with us and things become worse at the next family gathering.
            Here are ways to diffuse these emotional moments.
            Acknowledge the intentions of the speaker: "I know you mean well."
            Say how you feel. "It hurts me when you make fun of my work."
            Or give the speaker a face-saving option: "If you are worried that I am not cooking enough food, why don't you bring one of your favorite dishes."
            Most of the communication is in body language and tone of voice. You need to say it in an open, warm and caring way.
            Don't expect every disagreement to be resolved. Sometimes you just need to say, "Let's talk about this again later." You are not giving up or giving in. you are keeping your dignity and moving on.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Elizabeth's father died when she was nine. Her family was large, and very poor. She struggled for self esteem, but it was difficult when her clothes weren't as nice as the other kids and her new school was still unfamiliar.
            During a math lesson, Elizabeth stared at the chalkboard and was struggling to understand a concept. With every stroke of the chalk, she became more confused. She had suffered from chronic ear infections (感染), and had missed many days of her fifth grade year. When she finally got the courage to raise her little hand and ask Mr. Thompson how the problem was done, he became very angry. He marched her up in front of the class and told this insecure child that she was "incapable of learning and extremely stupid."
            This remark plagued (使…困扰) Elizabeth for years.
            Elizabeth drifted into marriage. After discovering her husband's long time infidelity (不忠), she found herself divorced with three young daughters. She moved back to her home state and tried to pick up the pieces she had left behind.
            Knowing that she would be the sole support of these children, and having no desire to remarry, Elizabeth started college. Like most good mothers, she wanted the best for her children. She didn't want to deprive them of their mother. She would rise early and stay up late to get every spare minute she could to study.
            When she received her first "A" she was confused. She thought there must be some mistake. This was Elizabeth, Elizabeth the stupid. When her good grades piled up, she realized for the first time that maybe Mr. Thompson was wrong. She graduated from Brigham Young University, and will soon be receiving her master's degree at California State University in San Bernardino.



    36.
    	
    The reason why Elizabeth stared at the chalkboard was that ______.
    A) she had ear infections and could not hear very well  
    B) she was still overwhelmed by the death of her father  
    C) too much homework had made her tired and sick

    C) strict with his students  
    D) incapable of making himself understood  

    正确答案： B
    38.

    A) was not a very responsible mother  
    B) needed to be able to support her children  
    C) knew she could achieve great success in college  
    D) wanted her children to have an educated mother  

    正确答案： D
    39.
    	
    Why was Elizabeth confused when she got her first "A"?
    A) Because she believed that it was a mistake.  
    B) Because she had not studied hard enough.  
    C) Because she felt hurt by other people's comments.
