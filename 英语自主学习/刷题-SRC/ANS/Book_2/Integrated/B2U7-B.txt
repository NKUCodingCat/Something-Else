    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 24 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            The story of our English language is typically one of   21    stealing from other languages. That is why English today has an   22    vocabulary of over one million words, while other major languages have far fewer.
        French, for example, has only about 75,000 words, and that includes English expressions like snack bar and hit parade. The French, however, do not like borrowing foreign words because they think it   23    their language. The government tries to ban words from English and declares that Walkman is not   24    ; so they invent a word, balladeur, which French kids are supposed to say instead ― but they don't.
        Walkman is   25    because it isn't even English.   26    , it was invented by the Japanese   27    who put two simple English words together to name their product. That doesn't bother us, but it does bother the French. Such is the   28    messiness of English. That happy   29    that willingness to accept words from anywhere, explains the richness of English and why it has become,   30    , the first truly global language.

    A) fascinating	B) to sum up	C) massive	D) manufacturers
    E) competition	F) desirable	G) estimated	H) tolerance
    I) sincere	J) Strictly speaking	K) corrupts	L) glorious
    M) making sense	N) to a very real extent	O) decade

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Napoleon Bonaparte was keen to learn English while in exile (流放), documents shown in Britain for the first time reveal.
            The deposed French emperor apparently wanted to learn the language of his foes so he could read what the London papers were writing about him. Scraps of paper from his English lessons in captivity on the island of St Helena go on show at London's National Maritime Museum on Thursday. They include lines of French haltingly translated by Napoleon into English.
            Count Emmanuel de las Cases, who accompanied the emperor into exile after he surrendered to the English at the Battle of Waterloo, wrote about his desire to learn the language in his memoirs (论文集). According to him, Napoleon had his first lesson on 17 January 1816, when he asked las Cases to dictate to him some sentences in French, which he then translated, using a table of auxiliary verbs and a dictionary.
            According to historian Dr Peter Hicks, las Cases describes how Napoleon hated being sat down to work like a schoolboy but steeled himself for the task. Dr Hicks said: "He was not necessarily anti-English. He had to fight because it was the enemy of France." He added: "In France people are amazed to find that he was learning English. But he didn't do it for pleasure. He wondered how much money he could have saved in translation if he could have learnt English."
            The documents are to feature in the Greenwich museum's Nelson and Napoleon exhibition, being held to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar. They are among a wide range of letters, paintings, personal items and objects lent by galleries and museums across Europe. The English lesson papers, described by Dr Hicks as quite remarkable, are on loan from the Foundation Napoleon in Paris.

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Taste is such a subjective matter that we don't usually conduct preference tests for food. The most you can say about anyone's preference is that it's one person's opinion. But because the two big cola companies ― Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola are marketed so aggressively, we've wondered how big a role taste preference actually plays in brand loyalty. We set up a taste test that challenged people who identified themselves as either Coca-Cola or Pepsi fans: Find your brand in a blind tasting.
            We invited staff volunteers who had a strong liking for either Coca-Cola Classic or Pepsi, Diet Coke, or Diet Pepsi. These were people who thought they'd have no trouble telling their brand from the other brand.
            We eventually located 19 regular cola drinkers and 27 diet cola drinkers. Then we fed them four unidentified samples of cola one at a time, regular colas for the one group, diet versions for the other. We asked them to tell us whether each sample was Coke or Pepsi; then we analyzed the records statistically to compare the participants' choices with what mere guess-work could have accomplished.
            Getting all four samples right was a tough test, but not too tough, we thought, for people who believed they could recognize their brand. In the end, only 7 out of 19 regular cola drinkers correctly identified their brand of choice in all four trials. The diet-cola drinkers did a little worse ― only 7 of 27 identified all four samples correctly.
            While both groups did better than chance would predict, nearly half the participants in each group made the wrong choice two or more times. Two people got all four samples wrong. Overall, half the participants did about as well on the last round of tasting as on the first, so fatigue, or taste burnout, was not a factor. Our preference test results suggest that only a few Pepsi participants and Coke fans may really be able to tell their favorite brand by taste and price.



    36.
    	
    According to the passage the preference test was conducted in order to ________.
    A) find out the role taste preference plays in a person's drinking  
    B) reveal which cola is more to the liking of the drinkers  
    C) show that a person's opinion about taste is mere guess-work  
    D) compare the ability of the participants in choosing their drinks  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    The statistics recorded in the preference tests show that ________.
    A) Coca-Cola and Pepsi are people's two most favorite drinks  
    B) there is not much difference in taste between Coca-Cola and Pepsi  
    C) few people had trouble telling Coca-Cola from Pepsi  
    D) people's tastes differ from one another  

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    It is implied in the first paragraph that ________.
    A) the purpose of taste tests is to promote the sale of colas  
    B) the improvement of quality is the chief concern of the two cola companies  
    C) the competition between the two colas is very strong  
    D) blind tasting is necessary for identifying fans
