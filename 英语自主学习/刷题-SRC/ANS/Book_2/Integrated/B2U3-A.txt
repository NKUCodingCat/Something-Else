    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            If you know exactly what you want, the best route to a job is to get specialized training. A recent survey shows that companies like graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training.
            That's especially true of booming fields that are challenging for workers. At Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, for example, bachelor's degree graduates get an average of four or five job offers with salaries ranging from the high teens to the low 20s and plenty of chances for rapid advancement. Large companies, especially, like a background of formal education coupled with work experience.
            But in the long run, too much specialization doesn't pay off. Business, which has been flooded with MBAs, no longer considers the degree an automatic stamp of approval. The MBA may open doors and command a higher salary initially, but the impact of a degree washes out after five years.
            As further evidence of the erosion (销蚀) of corporate (公司的) faith in specialized degrees, Michigan State Scheetz cites a pattern in corporate hiring practices, although companies tend to take on specialists as new hires, they often seek out generalists for middle and upper-level management. "They want someone who isn't constrained (限制) by nuts and bolts to look at the big picture", says Scheetz.
            This sounds suspiciously like a formal statement that you approve of the liberal-arts graduate. Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have: writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems, David Birch claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, "I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things," says Birch. Liberal-arts mean an academically thorough and strict program that includes literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior ― plus a computer course or two. With that under your belt, you can feel free to specialize, "A liberal-arts degree coupled with an MBA or some other technical training is a very good combination in the marketplace," says Scheetz.



    31.
    	
    What can we infer from the example in Para. 2?
    A) All of graduates get an average of four or five job offers.  
    B) Most of the graduates have chances for quick promotion.  
    C) They fail to get plenty of chances for rapid advancement.  
    D) Large companies prefer a background of formal education to work experience.

    32.
    	
    According to Para. 3, we can infer that ________.
    A) MBA programs will be as popular in five years’ time as they are now  
    B) in the long run, most specialization can insist people to get a brighter future  
    C) an MBA degree will fail to help promotion to managerial positions after five years  
    D) people will not pay attention to the degree of MBA

    D) people who have a degree of MBA

    B) liberal-arts people are more capable of handling changing situations  
    C) liberal-arts people must have attended MBA programs  
    D) liberal-arts people are completely trained in specialized fields  

    正确答案： B
    35.

    A) Specialists are cheaper to hire than generalists.  
    B) Job training is more important than formal schooling.  
    C) The author thinks that generalists will outdo specialists in management.  
    D) On-the-job training is less costly than education.  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            A few years ago it was fashionable to speak of generation gap, a division between young people and their elders. Parents complained that children did not show them proper respect and obedience, while children complained that their parents did not understand them at all. What had gone wrong? Why had the generation gap suddenly appeared? Actually, the generation gap has been around for a long time. Many critics argue that it is built into the fabric of our society.
            One important cause of the generation gap is the opportunity that young people have to choose their own life style. In more traditional societies, when children grow up, they are expected to live in the same area as their parents, to marry people that their parents know and approve of, and often to continue the family occupation. In our society, young people often travel great distances for their educations, move out of the family home at an early age, marry or live with people whom their parents have never met, and choose occupations different from those of their parents.
            In our upwardly mobile society, parents often expect their children to do better than they did: to find better jobs, to make more money, and to do all the things that they were unable to do. Often, however, the ambitions that parents have for their children are another cause of the division between them. Often, they discover that they have very little in common with each other.
            Finally, the speed at which changes take place in our society is another cause of the gap between the generations. In a traditional culture, elderly people are valued for their wisdom, but in our society the knowledge of a lifetime may become obsolete overnight. The young and the old seem to live in two very different worlds, separated by different skills and abilities.
            No doubt, the generation gap will continue to be a feature of American life for some time to come. Its causes are rooted in the freedoms and opportunities of our society, and in the rapid pace at which society changes.
