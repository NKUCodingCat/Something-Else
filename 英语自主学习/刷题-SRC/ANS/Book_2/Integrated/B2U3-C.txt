The new generation of migrant workers refers to those who were born in the 1980s or 1990s and left their rural hometowns to flock to cities in hopes of starting a career. Statistics indicate that the number of migrant workers in China has exceeded 220 million. More than half of them expressed expectations of becoming urban residents.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            We all know that DNA has the ability to identify individuals, but because it is inherited, there are also regions of the DNA strand which can relate an individual to his or her family (immediate and extended), tribal group and even an entire population. Molecular Genealogy (宗谱学) can use this unique identification provided by the genetic markers to link people together into family trees. Pedigrees (家谱) based on such genetic markers can mean a breakthrough for family trees where information is incomplete or missing due to adoption, illegitimacy or lack of records. There are many communities and populations which have lost precious records due to tragic events such as the fire in the Irish courts during Civil War in 1921 or American slaves for whom many records were never kept in the first place.
            The main objective of the Molecular Genealogy Research Group is to build a database containing over 100,000 DNA samples from individuals all over the world. These individuals will have provided a pedigree chart of at least four generations and a small blood sample. Once the database has enough samples to represent the world genetic make-up, it will eventually help in solving many issues regarding genealogies that could not be done by relying only on traditional written records. Theoretically, any individual will someday be able to trace his or her family origins through this database.
            In the meantime, as the database is being created, Molecular Genealogy can verify possible or suspected relationships between individuals. "For example, if two men sharing the same last name believe that they are related, but no written record proves this relationship, we can verify this possibility by collecting a sample of DNA from both and looking for common markers, in this case we can look primarily at the Y chromosome (染色体)", explains Ugo A. Perego, a member of the BYU Molecular Genealogy research team.



    31.
    	
    People in a large area may possess the same DNA thread because _________.
    A) DNA is characteristic of a region  
    B) they are beyond doubt of common ancestry  
    C) DNA strand has the ability to identify individuals  
    D) their unique identification can be provided via DNA  

    正确答案： B
    32.
    	
    The possible research of family trees is based on the fact that ________.
    A) genetics has achieved a breakthrough  
    B) genetic information contained in DNA can be revealed now  
    C) each individual carries a unique record of who he is and how he is related to others  
    D) we can use DNA to prove how distant an individual is to a family, a group or a population  

    正确答案： C
    33.
    	
    The Molecular Genealogy Research Group is building a database for the purpose of _________.
    A) offering assistance in working out genealogy-related problems  
    B) solving many issues without relying on traditional written records  
    C) providing a pedigree chart of at least four generations in the world  
    D) confirming the assumption that all individuals are of the same origin  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    If two men suspect for some reason that they have a common ancestor, __________.
    A) we can decide according to their family tree  
    B) we can find the truth from their genetic markers  
    C) we can compare the differences in their Y chromosome  
    D) we can look for written records to prove their relationship  

    正确答案： B
    35.
    	
    Which of the following CANNOT be inferred from the passage?
    A) We are a walking, living, breathing record of our ancestors.  
    B) Many American slaves did not know who their ancestors were.  
    C) An adopted child generally lacks enough information to prove his identity.  
    D) Molecular Genealogy can be used to prove relationship between individuals.  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            About six years ago I was eating lunch in a restaurant in New York City when a woman and a young boy sat down at the next table. I couldn't help overhearing parts of their conversation. At one point the woman asked: "So, how have you been?" And the boy ― who could not have been more than seven or eight years old ― replied. "Frankly, I've been feeling a little depressed lately."
            This incident stuck in my mind because it confirmed my growing belief that children are changing. As far as I can remember, my friends and I didn't find out we were "depressed" until we were in high school.
            The evidence of a change in children has increased steadily in recent years. Children don't seem childlike anymore. Children speak more like adults, dress more like adults and behave more like adults than they used to.
            Whether this is good or bad is difficult to say, but it certainly is different. Childhood as it once was no longer exists, why?
            Human development is based not only on innate (天生的) biological states, but also on patterns of access to social knowledge. Movement from one social rote to another usually involves learning the secrets of the new status. Children have always been taught adult secrets, but slowly and in stages: traditionally, we tell sixth graders things we keep hidden from fifth graders.
            In the last 30 years, however, a secret-revelation (揭示) machine has been installed in 98 percent of American homes. It is called television. Television passes information, and indiscriminately (不加区分地), to all viewers alike, be they children or adults. Unable to resist the temptation, many children turn their attention from printed texts to the less challenging, more vivid moving pictures.
            Communication through print, as a matter of fact, allows for a great deal of control over the social information to which children have access. Reading and writing involve a complex code of symbols that must be memorized and practiced. Children must read simple books before they can read complex materials.



    36.
    	
    The example in first paragraph shows that ________.
    A) most of children have a happy childhood  
    B) the author was depressed in high school  
    C) children are changing  
    D) the evidence of a change in children has decreased  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    Traditionally, children learn about the adult world through ________.
    A) exposure to social information  
    B) self-study  
    C) gradual guidance  
    D) connection with society  

    正确答案： C
    38.
    	
    According to the author, today's children seem adultlike is caused by ________.
    A) the slow decreasing of printed texts  
    B) the fast developing of human right  
    C) the widespread influence of television  
    D) the fast pace of human intellectual development  

    正确答案： C
    39.
    	
    Why does the author support the communication through print for children?
    A) Because it helps children to get more vivid moving pictures and social information.  
    B) Because it controls what children are to learn.  
    C) Because it enhances their interest in learning.  
    D) Because it pushes children to memorize and practice more.  

    正确答案： B
    40.
    	
    What is the author's attitude of the change in today's children?
    A) Happy.  
    B) Interesting.

    D) Noteworthy.
