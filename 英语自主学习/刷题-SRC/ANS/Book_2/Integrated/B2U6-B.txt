            But while I was feeling uneasy about the bridge I'd just   21    , I also began to feel a renewed sense of hopefulness about the   22    on the other side. I had had a long love affair with the written word that was   23    and apart from any of my roles. What we shared was   24    : It belonged to me and would always be mine   25    anything going on outside of me. I wasn't quite sure what my journey would involve, but I was   26    who would be at the other end. I steeled myself to travel the road that would lead me to a better understanding of who I was and of what I wanted out of life. I shared my mixed feelings with my husband.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            More and more Americans are finding that they must learn to cope with chronic illness. Granted, for some of the 125 million people with chronic illnesses, the problems are minor, but for 60 million others have multiple chronic conditions that can be serious or life-threatening.
            The toll of so much illness is enormous ― $510 billion annually. But chronic illness exacts an emotional toll as well, and it is in that realm that researchers are increasingly looking to the hard-won wisdom of patients to find ways to help others cope with diseases that might once have engulfed them in shame or despair.
            One view is that people with chronic illnesses should be neither pitied nor idealized, either by others or by themselves. Pity can come across as condescending. Turning someone into a hero may not help. Other mental health specialists, such as Ann Webster, take a somewhat different view. Some people with chronic illnesses do want to be seen as normal, she said, but others do seem truly heroic and may appreciate some recognition of that. "A lot of people grow and change in profound ways", Webster said. Some long-term survivors in her AIDS group "have changed and grown and turned into some of the most evolved and spiritual people, and they never were that way before." "It's really hard having a chronic illness, and knowing it is changing your life and your future," she said. Some people can throw their energies into beating their disease and returning to normal activities. But others can't beat the illness, no matter how hard they try. Many people can do this on their own, she said, but many also find it helpful to join support groups or see individual counselors. Ultimately, the task is to make meaning in the face of disability or imminent（即将发生的，逼近的） death, to reassess what's still important and what you can still do, when your old goals and dreams can no longer be met.



    31.
    	
    Ann Webster is different from other people in that she thinks ______.
    A) people with chronic diseases may feel encouraged when their heroic deeds are recognized  
    B) people with chronic illnesses wish to be treated in the same way as a normal person  
    C) idealizing people with chronic illnesses may put them under great mental pressure  
    D) sympathizing people with chronic illnesses may make them feel inferior to others  

    正确答案： A
    32.
    	
    Which of the following is NOT TRUE of the people in Webster's group?
    A) Many people turn to support groups for help.  
    B) Most of them realize they have to fight on their own.  
    C) Some of them return to normal life by fighting hard.  
    D) Some of them fail no matter how hard they try.  

    正确答案： B
    33.
    	
    We may infer from the passage that the author most probably agrees to the opinion that _____.
    A) people should stick to their dreams and goals no matter what happens  
    B) people should keep fighting against diseases and turn themselves into heroes  
    C) people should make their life meaningful by resetting goals when necessary  
    D) people should never give up fighting so long as there is still hope  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    This passage is focused on ______.
    A) the health condition of American people  
    B) the prevention of chronic illnesses  
    C) the serious cases of chronic illnesses  
    D) the spiritual aspect of people with chronic illnesses  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    Which of the following statements is TRUE as described in the passage?
    A) The treatment for chronic illnesses mainly depends on spiritual help.  
    B) People with chronic diseases can conquer their illness if they join support groups.  
    C) People's overcoming chronic illnesses demands enormous cost.  
    D) With people's utmost efforts, any chronic illness can be cured now.  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Elizabeth's father died when she was nine. Her family was large, and very poor. She struggled for self esteem, but it was difficult when her clothes weren't as nice as the other kids and her new school was still unfamiliar.
            During a math lesson, Elizabeth stared at the chalkboard and was struggling to understand a concept. With every stroke of the chalk, she became more confused. She had suffered from chronic ear infections (感染), and had missed many days of her fifth grade year. When she finally got the courage to raise her little hand and ask Mr. Thompson how the problem was done, he became very angry. He marched her up in front of the class and told this insecure child that she was "incapable of learning and extremely stupid."
            This remark plagued (使…困扰) Elizabeth for years.
            Elizabeth drifted into marriage. After discovering her husband's long time infidelity (不忠), she found herself divorced with three young daughters. She moved back to her home state and tried to pick up the pieces she had left behind.
            Knowing that she would be the sole support of these children, and having no desire to remarry, Elizabeth started college. Like most good mothers, she wanted the best for her children. She didn't want to deprive them of their mother. She would rise early and stay up late to get every spare minute she could to study.
            When she received her first "A" she was confused. She thought there must be some mistake. This was Elizabeth, Elizabeth the stupid. When her good grades piled up, she realized for the first time that maybe Mr. Thompson was wrong. She graduated from Brigham Young University, and will soon be receiving her master's degree at California State University in San Bernardino.



    36.
    	
    The reason why Elizabeth stared at the chalkboard was that ______.
    A) she had ear infections and could not hear very well  
    B) she was still overwhelmed by the death of her father  
    C) too much homework had made her tired and sick  
    D) what the teacher wrote was beyond her understanding  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    Mr. Thompson can be best described as a teacher who was ________.
    A) dull and stupid  
    B) impatient and cruel  
    C) strict with his students  
    D) incapable of making himself understood  

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    We can learn from the passage that Elizabeth started college because she ______.
    A) was not a very responsible mother  
    B) needed to be able to support her children  
    C) knew she could achieve great success in college  
    D) wanted her children to have an educated mother  

    正确答案： D
    39.
    	
    Why was Elizabeth confused when she got her first "A"?
    A) Because she believed that it was a mistake.  
    B) Because she had not studied hard enough.  
    C) Because she felt hurt by other people's comments.
