    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Everybody in this world is different from one another. But do you know that understanding differences can help you better manage your money?
            As we grow up, we gradually develop a set of our own values or beliefs. These are influenced by society, our family, the education we receive and so on. Once this value system is set up, it’s not easy to change later in life. Financial experts say that everyone also has their own belief of how to manage their finances. This is part of our value system and it has a great impact on the way we look after our money.
            According to our different values, experts put us in three categories. They are: the ant, the cricket and the snail.
            The ant ― works first
            Just like ants who work heart and soul in summer in order to store food for winter, these people don’t care about enjoying the moment. They work very hard and save money they earn so that they can enjoy life when they get old and retire. The ant loves to save but they could make more out of their money if they were willing to invest in some funds and stocks with low risk.
            The cricket ― fun first
            The cricket wants to enjoy everything now and doesn’t think too much about the future. They even borrow money when they really want something. Many young people now belong to this group. These people have little savings. When they get old, they might have problems. They should learn to save and buy insurance.
            The snail ― lives under pressure
            The snail refers to people who make life difficult for themselves. They take big long-term loans from the bank in order to buy things such as luxury houses. They are happy to take big loans even though they are not sure they can afford it. This can cause problems in the future. They should plan more carefully.



    31.
    	
    According to this passage, value system __________________.
    A) is a set of our own values or beliefs  
    B) is the way we spend our money

    D) save money they earn for the later life when they get old and retire

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Social change is more likely to occur in societies where there is a mixture of different kinds of people than in societies where people are similar in many ways. The simple reason for this is that there are more different ways of looking at things present in the first kind of society. There are more ideas, more interest, and more groups and organizations with different beliefs. In addition, there is usually a greater worldly interest and greater tolerance in mixed societies. All these factors tend to promote social change by opening more areas of life to decision. In a society where people are quite similar in many ways, there are fewer occasions for people to see the need or the opportunity for change because everything seems to be the same. And although conditions may not be satisfactory, they are at least customary and undisputed.
            Within a society, social change is also likely to occur more frequently and more readily in the material aspects of the culture than in the non-material, for example, in technology rather than in values; in what has been learned later in life rather than what was learned early; in the less basic and less emotional aspects of society than in their opposite; in the simple elements rather than in the complex ones; in form rather than in substance; and in elements that are acceptable to the culture rather than in strange elements.
            What’s more, social change is easier if it is gradual. For example, it comes more readily in human relations on a continuous scale rather than one with violent changes. This is one reason why change has not come more quickly to Black Americans as compared to other American minorities, because of the sharp difference in appearance between them and their white counterparts(对应的人).



    36.
    	
    The following factors tend to promote social change EXCEPT ________________.
    A) different kinds of people  
    B) different points of view  
    C) different interests  
    D) different conditions  

    正确答案： D

    A) more respect for different beliefs and behaviors  
    B) quicker adaptation to changing circumstances  
    C) greater willingness to change  
    D) greater readiness to agree to different opinions and ideas  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE within a society?
    A) Social change is less likely to occur in technology than in values.  
    B) What people learned in their early times tends to change quickly.  
    C) The basic and emotional aspects of society tend to slow down social change.  
    D) Strange elements are likely to quicken social change.  

    正确答案： C
    39.

    B) among Black Americans
