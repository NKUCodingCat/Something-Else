    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            In the world of entertainment, TV talk shows have undoubtedly flooded every inch of space on daytime television. And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one varies in style and format. But no two shows are more profoundly opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows. Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of "trash talk (废话)". The topics on his show are as shocking as shocking can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show themes of love, sex, cheating, guilt, hate, conflict and morality to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is a display and exploitation of society's moral catastrophes (灾难), yet people are willing to eat up the intriguing predicaments (困境) of other people's lives. Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its extreme, but Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show focuses on the improvement of society and an individual's quality of life. Topics range from teaching your children responsibility, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.
            Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being dumped on society. Jerry ends every show with a "final word". He makes a small speech that sums up the entire moral of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.
            Clean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main target audience are middle-class Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and stability to deal with life's tougher problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of an association with the young adults of society. These are 18- to 21-year-olds whose main troubles in life involve love, relationship, sex, money and peers. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned underneath the show's exploitation.
            While the two shows are as different as night and day, both have ruled the talk show circuit for many years now. Each one caters to a different audience while both have a strong following from large groups of fans. Ironically, both could also be considered pioneers in the talk show world.



    31.
    	
    Compared with other TV talk shows, both the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey are __________.
    A) more family-oriented  
    B) unusually popular

    A) remain fascinated by them  
    B) are ready to face up to them  
    C) remain indifferent to them  
    D) are willing to get involved in them  

    正确答案： A
    33.
    	
    Which of the following is likely to be a topic of the Oprah Winfrey show?
    A) A new type of robot.  
    B) Racist hatred.

    正确答案： B
    35.

    A) have monopolized the talk show circuit  
    B) exploit the weaknesses in human nature  
    C) appear at different times of the day  
    D) are targeted at different audiences  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Helen Admas Keller (1880 ― 1968), is an outstanding example of a person who conquered physical disabilities. A serious illness, which her doctor called "acute congestion of the stomach and brain," destroyed her sight and hearing at the age of about one. For almost five years, she grew up, as she later said, "wild and unruly, giggling and chuckling to express pleasure; kicking, scratching, uttering the choked screams of the deaf-mute to indicate the opposite." Then Helen's father took her to Alexander Graham Bell. He advised Keller to write to the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston. Shortly before the child was 7, Anne Sullivan arrived from Boston to teach her, who remained with Helen Keller until her death. Then Mary Agnes "Polly" Thomson, who had been Keller's secretary, took Sullivan's place.
            First she learned to write. Sullivan was able to make contact with the girl's mind through the sense of touch. Gradually, the child was able to connect words with objects. Once she understood, her progress was rapid. Then she learned to speak. Until she was 10 years old, Keller could talk only with the sign language of the deaf-mute. She decided she would learn to speak and took lessons from a teacher of the deaf. By the time she was 16, she could communicate well enough to go to preparatory school and to college. Finally she helped others. After college, Keller became concerned with the conditions of the blind and the deaf-blind. She became active on the staffs of the American Foundation for the blind and of the American Foundation for overseas Blind. In her later years, she became especially interested in bettering the conditions for the blind in developing and war-ravaged countries. An enthusiastic and untiring traveler, she lectured on their behalf in more than 25 countries on every continent except Antarctica.
            Keller received many awards of great distinction. They include the Chevalier's ribbon of the French Legion of Honor, the Alumni Achievement Award of Radcliffe College, and decorations from many governments.



    36.
