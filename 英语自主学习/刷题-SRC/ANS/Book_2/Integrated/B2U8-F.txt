    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Imagine a mass of floating waste is two times the size of the state of Texas. Texas has a land area of more than 678,000 square kilometers. So it might be difficult to imagine anything twice as big.
            All together, this mass of waste flowing in the North Pacific Ocean is known as the Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch. It weighs about 3,500,000 tons.
            The eastern part of the Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch is about l,600 kilometers west of California. The western part is west of the Hawaiian Islands and east of Japan. The area has been described as a kind of oceanic desert，with light winds and slow moving water currents. The water moves so slowly that garbage from all over the world collects there.
            In recent years, there have been growing concerns about the floating garbage and its effect on sea creatures and human health. Scientists say thousands of animals get trapped in the floating waste, resulting in death or injury. Even more die from a lack of food or water after swallowing pieces of plastic.
            The floating garbage can also have harmful effects on people. There is an increased threat of infection of disease from polluted waste, and from eating fish that swallowed waste. Divers can also get trapped in the plastic.
            Its existence first gained public attention in l997. That was when racing boat captain and oceanographer Charles Moore and his crew sailed into the garbage while returning from a racing event. Five years earlier, another oceanographer learned of the trash after a shipment of rubber ducks got lost at sea. Many of those toys are now part of the Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch.
            In August, 2009, a team from the University of California, San Diego became the latest group to travel to it. They were shocked by the amount of waste they saw. They gathered hundreds of sea creatures and water samples to measure the garbage patch's effect on ocean environment.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            More and more, the operations of our business, governments, and financial institutions are controlled by information that exists only inside computer memories. Anyone clever enough to modify this information for his own purposes can reap substantial rewards. Even worse, a number of people who have done this and been caught at it have managed to get away without punishment.     　　
            It's easy for computer crimes to go undetected if no one checks up on what the computer is doing, but even if the crime is detected, the criminal may walk away not only unpunished but with a glowing recommendation from his former employers. Of course, we have no statistics on crimes that go undetected. But it's disturbing to note how many of the crimes we do know about were detected by accident, not by systematic inspections or other security procedures. The computer criminals who have been caught may have been the victims of uncommonly bad luck. 　　
            For example, a certain keypunch operator complained of having to stay overtime to punch extra cards. Investigation revealed that the extra cards she was being asked to punch were for dishonest transactions. In another case, dissatisfied employees of the thief tipped off the company that was being robbed. Unlike other lawbreakers, who must leave the country, commit suicide, or go to jail, computer criminals sometimes escape punishment, demanding not only that they not be charged but that they be given good recommendations and perhaps other benefits. All too often, their demands have been met.     　
            Why? Because company executives are afraid of the bad publicity that would result if the public found out their computer had been misused.
            They hesitate at the thought of a criminal boasting in open court of how he juggled the most confidential records right under the noses of the company's executives, accountants, and security staff. And so another computer criminal departs with just the recommendations he needs to continue his crimes elsewhere.



    36.
    	
    It can be concluded from the passage that _______.
    A) it is still impossible to detect computer crimes today  
    B) computer crimes are one of most serious problems in the operation of the financial institutions  
    C) computer criminals can escape punishment because they can't be detected  
    D) people commit computer crimes at the request of their company  

    正确答案： B
    37.
    	
    It is implied in the third paragraph that _______.
    A) more computer crimes go undetected than are discovered  
    B) the rapid increase of computer crimes is a troublesome problem  
    C) most computer criminals are smart enough to cover up their crimes  
    D) most computer criminals who are caught blame their bad luck  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    Which of the following is mentioned in the passage?
    A) A strict law against computer crimes must be enforced.  
    B) Companies need to impose restrictions on confidential information.  
    C) Companies will guard against computer crimes to protect their reputation.  
    D) Companies usually hesitate to uncover computer crimes.  

    正确答案： D
    39.
    	
    The underlying reason for the computer criminals to get recommendations he needs is that _______.
    A) they have skills formidably difficult for others to master  
    B) the employers are afraid that they would take avenge if punished  
    C) the employers are much afraid of bringing the public into disbelief towards them through the criminals' words in open court  
    D) those who commit crimes do not mean bad  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    What may happen to computer criminals once they are caught?
    A) With bad reputation they can hardly find another job.  
    B) They will be denied access to confidential records.  
    C) They may walk away and easily find another job.  
    D) They must leave the country or go to jail.
