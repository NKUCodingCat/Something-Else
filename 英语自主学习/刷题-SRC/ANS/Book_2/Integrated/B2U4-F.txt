    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            It is hardly necessary for me to cite all the evidence of the depressing state of literacy. These figures from the Department of Education are sufficient: 27 million Americans cannot read at all, and a further 35 million read at a level that is less than sufficient to survive in our society.
            But my own worry today is less that of the overwhelming problem of elemental literacy than it is of the slightly more luxurious problem of the decline in the skill even of the middle-class reader, of his unwillingness to afford those spaces of silence, those luxuries of domesticity and time and concentration, that surround the image of the classic act of reading. It has been suggested that almost 80 percent of America's literate, educated teenagers can no longer read without an accompanying noise (music) in the background or a television screen flickering at the corner of their field of perception. We know very little about the brain and how it deals with simultaneous conflicting input, but every common-sense intuition suggests we should be profoundly alarmed. This violation of concentration, silence, solitude goes to the very heart of our notion of literacy, this new form of part-reading, of part-perception against background distraction, renders impossible certain essential acts of apprehension and concentration, let alone that most important tribute any human being can pay to a poem or a piece of prose he or she really loves, which is to learn it by heart. Not by brain, by heart; the expression is vital.
            Under these circumstances, the question of what future there is for the arts of reading is a real one. Ahead of us lie technical, psychic, and social transformations probably much more dramatic than those brought about by Gutenberg, the German inventor in printing. The Gutenberg revolution, as we now know it, took a long time; its effects are still being debated. The information revolution will touch every facet of composition, publication, distribution, and reading. No one in the book industry can say with any confidence what will happen to the book as we've known it.



    31.
    	
    The picture of the reading ability of the American people, drawn by the author, is _______.
    A) rather bleak  
    B) fairly bright  
    C) very impressive  
    D) quite encouraging  

    正确答案： A
    32.
    	
    The author's biggest concern is that _______.
    A) elementary school children's disinterest in reading classics  
    B) the surprisingly low rate of literacy in the U.S.  
    C) the musical setting American readers require for reading  
    D) the reading ability and reading behavior of the middle class people  

    正确答案： D
    33.
    	
    A major problem with most adolescents who can read is_______ .
    A) their fondness of music and TV programs  
    B) their ignorance of various forms of art and literature  
    C) their lack of attentiveness and basic understanding  
    D) their inability to focus on conflicting input  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    The author claims that the best way a reader can show admiration for a piece of poetry or prose is ________.
    A) to be able to appreciate it and memorize it  
    B) to analyze its essential features  
    C) to think it over conscientiously  
    D) to make a fair appraisal of its artistic value

    35.
    	
    About the future of the arts of reading the author feels _______.
    A) upset  
    B) uncertain  
    C) alarmed  
    D) pessimistic  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            It is a devastating prospect. Terrorists electronically break into the computers that control the water supply of a large American city, open and close valves to contaminate the water with untreated sewage or toxic chemicals, and then release it in a devastating flood. As the emergency services struggle to respond, the terrorists strike again, shutting down the telephone network and electrical power grid with just a few mouse clicks. Businesses are paralysed, hospitals are overwhelmed and roads are gridlocked as people try to flee.
            This kind of scenario is invoked by doom-mongers who insist that stepping up physical security since the September 11th attacks is not enough. Road-blocks and soldiers around power stations cannot prevent digital terrorism. "Until we secure our cyber-infrastructure, a few keystrokes and an Internet connection is all one needs to disable the economy and endanger lives," Lamar Smith, a Texas congressman, told a judiciary committee in February.
            It is true that utility companies and other operators of critical infrastructure are increasingly connected to the Internet. But just because an electricity company's customers can pay their bills online, it does not necessarily follow that the company's critical control systems are vulnerable to attack. Control systems are usually kept entirely separate from other systems, for good reason. They tend to be obscure, old-fashioned systems that are incompatible with Internet technology anyhow.
            On September 18th Richard Clarke, America's cyber-security tsar, unveiled his long-awaited blueprint for securing critical infrastructure from digital attacks. It was a bit of a damp squib, making no firm recommendations and proposing no new regulation or legislation. But its lily-livered approach might, in fact, be the right one. When a risk has been overstated, inaction may be the best policy.
    It is difficult to avoid comparisons with the "millennium bug" and the predictions of widespread computer chaos arising from the change of date to the year 2000. Then, as now, the alarm was sounded by technology vendors and consultants, who stood to gain from scare-mongering. But Ross Anderson, a computer scientist at Cambridge University, prefers to draw an analogy with the environmental lobby.

    We learn from the first paragraph that ____________.
    A) terrorists could plunge a large American city into chaos through electronic attack  
    B) American people have no experience in dealing with terrorists  
    C) the computer systems of utility companies are rather vulnerable  
    D) the response of emergency services is far from satisfactory  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    Speaking of the doom-mongers, the author implies that_____________.
    A) their worries are quite reasonable  
    B) their warnings should be taken seriously  
    C) they exaggerate the threat utility companies are facing  
    D) they are familiar with the way terrorists strike  

    正确答案： C
    38.

    A) terrorists may launch another “Pearl Harbor” attack  
    B) terrorists have ample capital and time to prepare a stunning strike  
    C) it is very costly and time-consuming to attack critical infrastructure  
    D) it is unlikely that terrorists would resort to electronic means to attack critical infrastructure  

    正确答案： D
    39.
