    Script: Project Zero was founded at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1967 by the philosopher Nelson Goodman to study and improve education in and through the arts. Goodman believed that arts learning should be studied as a serious cognitive activity, but that "zero" had been firmly established about the field; hence, the project was given its name.
            Today, Project Zero is building on this research to help create communities of reflective, independent learners; to enhance deep understanding within and across disciplines; and to promote critical thinking. Project Zero's mission is to understand and enhance learning, thinking, and creativity in the arts, as well as humanistic and scientific disciplines, at the individual and institutional levels.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            Each summer, no matter how pressing my work schedule is, I take off one day exclusively for my son. We call it dad-son day. This year our third stop was the amusement park, where he discovered that he was tall enough to ride one of the fastest roller coasters (过山车) in the world. We blasted through face-stretching turns and loops for ninety seconds. Then, as we stepped off the ride, he shrugged and, in a distressingly calm voice, remarked that it was not exciting as other rides he'd been on. As I listened, I began to sense something seriously out of balance.
            Throughout the season, I noticed similar events all around me. Parents seemed hard pressed to find new thrills for indifferent kids. Surrounded by ever-greater stimulation, their young faces were looking disappointed and bored.
            Facing their children's complaints of "nothing to do", parents were shelling out large numbers of dollars for various forms of entertainment. In many cases the money seemed to do little more than buy transient relief from the terrible moans of their bored children. This set me pondering the obvious question: "How can it be so hard for kids to find something to do when there's never been such a range of stimulating entertainment available to them?"
            What really worries me is the intensity of the stimulation. I watch my little daughter's face as she absorbs the powerful onslaught (冲击) of arousing visuals and bloody special effects in movies.
            Why do children immersed in this much excitement seem starved for more? That was, I realized, the point. I discovered during my own reckless adolescence that what creates excitement is not going fast, but going faster. Thrills have less to do with speed than changes in speed.
            I'm concerned about the cumulative effect of years at these levels of feverish activity. It is no mystery to me why many teenagers appear apathetic (麻木的) and burned out, with a "been there, done that" air of indifference toward much of life. As increasing numbers of friends' children are prescribed medications ― stimulants to deal with inattentiveness at school or anti-depressants to help with the loss of interest and joy in their lives ― I question the role of kids' boredom in some of the diagnoses.
            My own work is focused on the chemical imbalances and biological factors related to behavioral and emotional disorders. These are complex problems. Yet I've been reflecting more and more on how the pace of life and the intensity of stimulation may be contributing to the rising rates of psychiatric problems among children and adolescents in our society.



    31.

    D) balancing school work with extracurricular activities  

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            The U.S. Department of Labor statistics indicate that there is an oversupply of college-trained workers and that this oversupply is increasing. Already there is an overabundance of teachers, engineers, physicists and other specialists. Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that aren’t there. The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree. These “temporary” jobs have a habit of becoming permanent.
            On the other hand, there is a tremendous need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanics, and TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can handle and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old distinction that white-collar workers make a better living than blue-collar workers no longer holds true.
            The reason for this situation is the traditional myth that a college degree is a passport to a prosperous future. Parents begin telling their children this myth before they are out of grade school (小学). Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn’t matter. Everybody should go to college.
            One result of this emphasis on a college education is that many people go to college who do not belong there. Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college, half of them do not graduate with their class. Many of them drop out within the first year. Some struggle on for two or three years and then give up.



    36.
    	
    What do the U.S. Department of Labor statistics show?
    A) There is an oversupply of labor force and this oversupply is increasing.  
    B) Many college graduates find it difficult to get jobs for which they were trained.  
    C) There is a short supply of teachers, engineers and other professionals.  
    D) There are more temporary jobs than permanent ones in U.S. companies.  

    正确答案： B
    37.
    	
    What does the author mean by saying "these 'temporary' jobs have a habit of becoming permanent" (in Para.1)?
    A) College graduates have the habit of taking temporary jobs.  
    B) Many college graduates are not willing to change their jobs.  
    C) Many college graduates might never find jobs for which they were trained.  
    D) Once college graduates take a temporary job, they soon become used to it.  

    正确答案： C
    38.

    A) blue-collar workers made a better living than white-collar workers

    C) students seldom dropped out of colleges and universities
