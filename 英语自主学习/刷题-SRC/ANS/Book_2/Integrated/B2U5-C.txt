    Script:         Sometimes I have thought it would be an excellent rule to live each day as if we should die tomorrow. Such an attitude would emphasize sharply the values of life. We should live each day with gentleness, vigor, and a keenness of appreciation which are often lost when time stretches before us in the constant panorama of more days and months and years to come. There are those who, of course, who would adopt the epicurean (享乐者) motto of "Eat, drink, and be merry," but most people would be chastened (磨练) by the certainty of impendent death. It has often been noted that those who live, or have lived, in the shadow of death bring a mellow sweetness to everything they do. Most of us, however, take life for granted. We know that one day we must die, but usually we picture that day as far in the future. When we are in buoyant (乐观的) health, death is all but unimaginable. We seldom think of it. The days stretch out in an endless vista. So we go about petty tasks, hardly aware of our listless attitude toward life.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            In the world of entertainment, TV talk shows have undoubtedly flooded every inch of space on daytime television. And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one varies in style and format. But no two shows are more profoundly opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows. Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of "trash talk (废话)". The topics on his show are as shocking as shocking can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show themes of love, sex, cheating, guilt, hate, conflict and morality to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is a display and exploitation of society's moral catastrophes (灾难), yet people are willing to eat up the intriguing predicaments (困境) of other people's lives. Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its extreme, but Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show focuses on the improvement of society and an individual's quality of life. Topics range from teaching your children responsibility, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.
            Compared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being dumped on society. Jerry ends every show with a "final word". He makes a small speech that sums up the entire moral of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.
            Clean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main target audience are middle-class Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and stability to deal with life's tougher problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of an association with the young adults of society. These are 18- to 21-year-olds whose main troubles in life involve love, relationship, sex, money and peers. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned underneath the show's exploitation.
            While the two shows are as different as night and day, both have ruled the talk show circuit for many years now. Each one caters to a different audience while both have a strong following from large groups of fans. Ironically, both could also be considered pioneers in the talk show world.



    31.
    	
    Compared with other TV talk shows, both the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey are __________.
    A) more family-oriented  
    B) unusually popular  
    C) more profound  
    D) relatively formal  

    正确答案： C
    32.

    A) remain fascinated by them  
    B) are ready to face up to them  
    C) remain indifferent to them  
    D) are willing to get involved in them  

    正确答案： A
    33.
    	
    Which of the following is likely to be a topic of the Oprah Winfrey show?
    A) A new type of robot.  
    B) Racist hatred.  
    C) Family budget planning.

    A) ironical  
    B) sensitive  
    C) instructive  
    D) cynical  

    正确答案： B
    35.
    	
    We can learn from the passage that the two talk shows ____________.
    A) have monopolized the talk show circuit  
    B) exploit the weaknesses in human nature  
    C) appear at different times of the day  
    D) are targeted at different audiences  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            An allowance is an important tool for teaching kids how to budget, save and make their own decisions. Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly. How large an allowance is appropriate? Experts say there is no right amount. Actual amounts differ from region to region, and from family to family.
            To set an appropriate allowance for your child, work up a weekly budget. Allow for entertainment expenditures such as movies and snacks. Next, include everyday expenses such as lunch money, bus fare, and school supplies. "If you make the child responsible for these 'ills'," says Josephine Swanson, a consumer specialist," he or she will learn to budget for necessary expenditures."
            Finally, add some extra money to make saving possible. If you can, keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends. A child whose purchasing power falls away below his peers' can feel left out. It can be tough, but avoid excusing your children when they make a mistake with their allowance. When Brooke Stephens was ten and growing up in Jacksonville, her mother gave her $5 a week, $1.75 of which was for bus fare and lunch." If you lose your money," Brooke's mother told her, "you walk home. One week the girl spent all her allowance in a candy store, and then she called home for a ride. "Mom made me walk home," recalls Stephens, now a financial planner in Brooklyn. "At first I was angry. But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson."
            Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied di?rectly to a child's daily chores. Kids should help around the house not because they get paid for it but because they share responsibilities as members of a family. You might, however, pay a child for doing extra jobs at home, which can develop his or her initiative.



    36.
    	
    Which of the following is the main idea of the passage?
    A) How to develop a child’s initiative.  
    B) How to work up an amount of pocket money.  
    C) How to teach a child to save money.  
    D) How to teach a child about money.  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    It can be inferred from the passage that if a child is given an allowance, he or she may ________.
    A) spend all the money very soon  
    B) be spoiled and finally ruined  
    C) feel responsible and careful about money  
    D) lost the money and can not return home  

    正确答案： C
    38.
    	
    The words "his peers"(in Para.4) refer to ________.

    正确答案： D
    39.
