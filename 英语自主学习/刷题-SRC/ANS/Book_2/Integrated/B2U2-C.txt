            Near the end of the year, when I put on the Salvation Army's red apron, something changes inside me. Instead of feeling out of   21    economically, I begin to feel a genuine sense of belonging. As I   22    my bell, people stop to share their personal stories of how much it meant to be helped when they were going through a   23    time. People helping people is something I feel deeply connected to. While I'm ringing the bell,   24    strangers have brought me hot chocolate, leaving me with a lingering smile. Countless   25    have helped to keep me warm with the   26    of the season: "Thank you for ringing on such a cold day." "Can I get you a cup of coffee?" "Bless you for your good work." December is the time of year I feel   27    .
            Over the past four years, I've grown to understand more about myself because of a single question from a   28    child. As I've examined what it means to be poor, it has become clear to me what I am most   29    for: both my tangible and my intangible good   30    .

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            The first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the United States. It was a small coffee shop that roasted its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three more Starbucks stores in Seattle.
            Things really began to change for the company in 1981. That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who ran Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, and he was curious about the company. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did, and he liked what he saw. He wanted to become part of the company. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing.
            In 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The unique atmosphere of the coffee bars there caught his eye. To Schultz it seemed that Italians spent their daily lives in three places: home, work, and coffee bars. His experience in Italy gave him a new idea for Starbucks back in Seattle.
            Schultz created an atmosphere for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Between 1987 and 1992, Starbucks opened 150 new stores ― and that was only the beginning. In fact, by the year 2000, three new Starbucks stores opened somewhere around the world every day!
            Today, Starbucks has thousands of stores, including stores in twenty-six countries. One thing that helps make Starbucks succeed in cities outside the United States is the way Starbucks works with local stores and restaurants. By working together with a store already in the city, Starbucks gets an understanding of customers in the city. This understanding helps Starbucks open stores in the right locations for their customers.



    31.

    D) Opening restaurants in just a few locations each year.  

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            A value could be defined as a belief or attitude you hold close or something that you want to keep as a standard for judging yourself and the rest of the world. It is the basis for your sense of right and wrong, good and bad.
            It is our values that drive us to act in certain ways, to lead a certain lifestyle and to shun certain habits. For instance, if you truly believe that drinking alcohol is not a good thing, you will not drink. And if you do, you will probably feel guilty and regret it later.
            Each of us has a unique value system ― almost as unique as our fingerprints. A value system is not just something that is passed down from parents or learnt through behavior in schools, etc. It is developed through personal experiences, in combination with the values that our immediate society lends to us.
            Yet, value systems can differ dramatically even within the same family or group of friends. For instance, your parents may think it is wrong to marry out of your own culture or community, while your brother may not believe in marriage at all.
            Similarly, you may not like lying to your parents, but your best friend may think it is just another way of making life easier.
            Values can be related to health, cultural awareness, religion, preservation of nature, loyalty, wealth, creativity, independence, search for fame or peace, education, and much more.
            Any combination of these separate values will form a person's values system. To figure out yours, you must do a lot of soul-searching, and ask yourself questions about what really matters to you and what you deeply believe in, or what are the issues that you are not willing to compromise on ― that will be your unique set of values.
