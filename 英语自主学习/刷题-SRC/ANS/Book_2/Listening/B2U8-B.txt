    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Chinese vice premier Hui Liangyu on Friday called for better management of the country's welfare lottery industry.

    A ceremony of the 20th anniversary of China's welfare lottery was held in Beijing. Hui said the welfare lottery industry had made great contributions to the nation's public welfare. The lottery has raised a total of 242.3 billion yuan over the past two decades, of which 80.9 billion yuan was raised for national public welfare funds, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. With the rapid development of the welfare lottery industry, this year the nation's welfare lottery sales are expected to exceed 60 billion yuan, said the ministry. Civil Affairs Minister Li Xueju said the welfare lottery had become an effective force to promote the country's social welfare and would continue to make a contribution to building a harmonious society.

    China's lottery market has expanded quickly over the last two decades but the China Welfare Lottery Management Center still describes the market penetration of the lottery in China as low.
    As in 2006, China's per capita lottery sales accounted for only 0.66 percent of the per capita net income, equivalent to only one to two percent of the world average.
