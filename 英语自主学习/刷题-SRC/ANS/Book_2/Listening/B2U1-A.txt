    Script: His time on the basketball court became known as the Ming Dynasty in 2002, but the rein of Yao Ming has come to an end, with the Chinese superstar announcing his retirement on July the 28th. The "smiling giant" gave basketball a foothold in the world's most populous market where there are over 12,550,000 television viewers. And he became a source of national pride and inspiration in China which has a population of over 1.3 billion.

    With his career over, the focus has turned to who will replace him, and what will it mean to the future of basketball in China where there are, some estimate, 8,600,000 young fans. At seven-foot-and-six-inches tall, Yao is a towering presence in every way. In 2003, he was drafted to the North American National Basketball Association as the number one pick ― a first for an overseas player. But now, at the age of 30, his days on the court are over.
