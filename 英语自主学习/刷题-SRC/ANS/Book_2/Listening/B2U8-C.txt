    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: We all fantasize about hitting the big one, or desire that we could fall into instant riches by simply choosing the right winning lottery numbers or letting them be at random generated from a programmed lottery machine onto a little piece of paper, but it has usually been claimed that we should be extremely cautious about what we hope for as everything includes a price, as well as winning the lottery, particularly when it involves winning millions of dollars. The particular chances of turning into a multimillion dollar lottery winner are astronomical to start with, but when destiny interrupts, miraculous things can occur that will forever change someone’s life, for good or bad.
    Although huge prize can change someone's life style dramatically, it is claimed that if you were happy before winning a huge sum of money, then you would be satisfied afterwards, but if you were an extremely unhappy person to start with, winning a multimillion dollar jackpot would change absolutely nothing except the size of your bank account.
    Who in his right mind would not be totally happy in winning a huge multimillion dollar lottery? Whether you play expressly for entertainment purposes, or to catapult a luxurious way of life, the results of landing a windfall in the lottery can bring more heartache than relief.
