    Script: As a general rule of thumb, the further you travel from Western Europe and North America, the more the delicacies challenge Western notions of what’s delicious, or even edible. China is where you'll find the century egg, an egg preserved for months until it turns grey, green and/or brown. It's where you’ll find bird's nest soup, made from the nests of the cave swift, whose saliva gives the dish its distinctive snot-like mouthfeel. And it's where you’ll find drunken shrimp, prepared by tossing live crustaceans into strong alcohol and eating them while they're still wriggling. "That one didn't taste bad," says Leu, "but it made my soul feel bad."

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: There is not much call for a complete working knowledge of table manners in America today. Many families only gather all at once around the dinner table at holiday feasts, and most restaurants are too casual to require, or even to allow for, more than basic good table manners. If, having dropped his napkin were to attempt to practice proper manner by signaling a member of the staff to bring a fresh one, he would probably have to do without a napkin at all. Try as he might to make eye contact and indicate the nature of the problem with eyebrows and glances, he is likely to succeed only in causing his date to think he is making a play for the server. Although strict good manners avoid placing a used eating tool back on the table, the server removing a plate on which a fork has quite properly been positioned "pointing at 11 o'clock" might just put that item back where it started, making more of noises than if the diner had simply done it herself.
