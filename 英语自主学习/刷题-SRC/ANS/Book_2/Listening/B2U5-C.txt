    Section B 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.


    Excess body fat (6)_________________ of systemic inflammation and the release of dangerous chemical messengers that damage the delicate inner lining of our arteries; this (7)_________________ for vascular dysfunction. As we pass age 35, there is (8)_________________ due to slowing metabolism, unchanged calorie intake and less physical activity.

    Researchers have been encouraged that the obesity rate has (9)_________________ at 34% over the past 5 years. The number of (10)_________________ and obese individuals has also remained (11)_________________ for the same period. New research suggests that the (12)_________________ will continue over the next 40 years to (13)_________________ at 42% of men, women and children registering as clinically obese.

    In the early 1900’s, 1 in 150 people were obese. By 1971 the obesity rate climbed to 14%. 40 years later that number has (14)_________________ 34%. Something has changed during this period to create such an explosion in body fat (15)_________________ .

    Script: Overweight and obesity are known to dramatically increase the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Excess body fat fuels the fire of systemic inflammation and the release of dangerous chemical messengers that damage the delicate inner lining of our arteries; this sets the stage for vascular dysfunction. As we pass age 35, there is a natural tendency to gain weight due to slowing metabolism, unchanged calorie intake and less physical activity.

    Researchers have been encouraged that the obesity rate has stabilized at 34% over the past 5 years. The number of overweight and obese individuals has also remained steady for the same period. New research suggests that the upward trend will continue over the next 40 years to peak at 42% of men, women and children registering as clinically obese.

    In the early 1900’s, 1 in 150 people were obese. By 1971 the obesity rate climbed to 14%. 40 years later that number has jumped to 34%. Something has changed during this period to create such an explosion in body fat accumulation. We are still the same genetically diverse people we were 100 years ago, yet our metabolism has been dramatically altered toward fat storage.

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: This week's challenge is to find out how much fat is in the food you buy and how you can reduce your intake. The ideas below should get you started.
    First, your aims. A good daily target is to keep fat intake below 100g for men and 75g for women. If you're trying to lose weight, your target should be 70g for men and 55g for women.
    Second, problems with fat. There are nine calories in every gram of fat ― more than twice as many as in the equivalent amount of protein or carbohydrate. That's why cutting down on high-fat foods is the first step to a healthier diet. A diet high in saturated fat ― the type found in animal produce ― is also one of the leading factors in heart disease, the number one cause of premature death in the UK. Saturated fat can block the arteries that carry blood away from the heart, leading to high blood pressure and heart attacks.
    Third, how to eat low fat. If you're used to eating high-fat food on most days, it's time to swap these for lower fat and starchy alternatives. Try the following suggestions, aiming to do as many as possible this week, but making them all part of your routine in the long-term:
    Use a low-fat spread instead of butter or margarine.
    Eat fewer meat pies, cheesy dishes and sausages, and choose lean meat instead.
    Don't add oil or butter to vegetables and potatoes.
    Have a couple of meat-free days a week and experiment with vegetarian dishes.
