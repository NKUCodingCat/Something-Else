    Script: Overweight and obesity are known to dramatically increase the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Excess body fat fuels the fire of systemic inflammation and the release of dangerous chemical messengers that damage the delicate inner lining of our arteries; this sets the stage for vascular dysfunction. As we pass age 35, there is a natural tendency to gain weight due to slowing metabolism, unchanged calorie intake and less physical activity.

    Researchers have been encouraged that the obesity rate has stabilized at 34% over the past 5 years. The number of overweight and obese individuals has also remained steady for the same period. New research suggests that the upward trend will continue over the next 40 years to peak at 42% of men, women and children registering as clinically obese.

    In the early 1900’s, 1 in 150 people were obese. By 1971 the obesity rate climbed to 14%. 40 years later that number has jumped to 34%. Something has changed during this period to create such an explosion in body fat accumulation. We are still the same genetically diverse people we were 100 years ago, yet our metabolism has been dramatically altered toward fat storage.

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Welcome to your first weekly exercise challenge and the start of a fitter, healthier lifestyle. The golden rule for any successful exercise program is gradual progression. If you try to do too much too soon, you may lose steam and risk injury. This program enables you to build up your activity level slowly, so the process of getting fitter is enjoyable, safe and, above all, sustainable.
    Today we will talk about walking. Walkers enjoy many of the benefits that people who engage in far more vigorous activities experience. They also have a lower risk of injury, a higher level of adherence and far more opportunities to fit their activity into a busy day. And walking itself is the simplest, most natural form of human movement. You don't need any specific training or specialist equipment, except supportive shoes.
    At this stage, it doesn't matter how fast or slowly you walk, or whether you have to stop to catch your breath. Simply set out for five minutes, turn around and walk back. It's up to you whether you walk on five consecutive days (for example, weekdays) or divide the walks up throughout the week. By the end of this week, you'll have covered somewhere between 5km and 10.5km (3.5 miles and 6.5 miles), depending on your pace, and will have burned as many as 650 calories.
