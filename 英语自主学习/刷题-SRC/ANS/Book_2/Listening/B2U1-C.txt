    Script: His time on the basketball court became known as the Ming Dynasty in 2002, but the rein of Yao Ming has come to an end, with the Chinese superstar announcing his retirement on July the 28th. The "smiling giant" gave basketball a foothold in the world's most populous market where there are over 12,550,000 television viewers. And he became a source of national pride and inspiration in China which has a population of over 1.3 billion.

    With his career over, the focus has turned to who will replace him, and what will it mean to the future of basketball in China where there are, some estimate, 8,600,000 young fans. At seven-foot-and-six-inches tall, Yao is a towering presence in every way. In 2003, he was drafted to the North American National Basketball Association as the number one pick ― a first for an overseas player. But now, at the age of 30, his days on the court are over.

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: About nine million people rock climb in the United States. Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for personal satisfaction. Others compete. Rock climbing can be dangerous. But there are many methods and protective devices that can increase a climber's safety.
    There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and attach devices to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the devices. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling.
    Sports climbing is similar. However, in those cases the protective devices are permanently placed in the rock. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood or concrete have places for the climber's hands and feet.
    Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice.
