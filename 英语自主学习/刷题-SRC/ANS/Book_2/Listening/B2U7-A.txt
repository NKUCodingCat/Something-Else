    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Don't know where to start working on your career image? You're not alone because most companies don't have specific guidelines about what to wear to work.

    One of the best clues to company dress codes is what your boss wears. Just think about the styles that the highest-level woman in your organization wears and use them in your wardrobe. Does she wear mostly skirt suits? Or does she rely on pantsuits? Does she wear hose or bare legs? Open-toed shoes or pumps?

    If you don't have a reliable female executive to emulate, then trade on what the men are wearing. If they wear suits and ties every day, your best bet is to use pantsuits and skirt suits: the most formal of business looks.

    Some organizations encourage employees to dress as well or better than their customers, especially for sales people and others that meet clients outside the office. For information technology professionals, this may mean corporate casual (more on this below), for pharmaceutical sales it may mean a pantsuit, for a lawyer it may mean a matched skirt suit. One way to always be prepared is to keep an extra "meet the client" outfit at the office for surprise meetings.
