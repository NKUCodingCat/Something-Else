    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

    Script: As a general rule of thumb, the further you travel from Western Europe and North America, the more the delicacies challenge Western notions of what’s delicious, or even edible. China is where you'll find the century egg, an egg preserved for months until it turns grey, green and/or brown. It's where you’ll find bird's nest soup, made from the nests of the cave swift, whose saliva gives the dish its distinctive snot-like mouthfeel. And it's where you’ll find drunken shrimp, prepared by tossing live crustaceans into strong alcohol and eating them while they're still wriggling. "That one didn't taste bad," says Leu, "but it made my soul feel bad."

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: The traditional English breakfast consists of eggs, bacon, sausages, fried bread, baked beans and mushrooms. Even though not many people will eat this for breakfast today, it is always served in hotels and guest houses around Britain. The traditional English breakfast is called the 'Full English' and sometimes referred to as "The Full English Fry-up".
    Many children at school and adults at work will have a "packed lunch". This typically consists of a sandwich, a packet of crisps, a piece of fruit and a drink. The "packed lunch" is kept in a plastic container.
    A typical British meal for dinner is "meat and two veg". We have hot brown gravy which is traditionally made from the juices of the roast meat, but more often today from a packet! And we put it on the meat and usually the vegetables. One of the vegetables is almost always potatoes.
    The traditional meal is rarely eaten nowadays, apart from on Sundays. A recent survey found that most people in Britain eat curry! Rice or pasta dishes are now favoured as the "British Dinner". Vegetables grown in England, like potatoes, carrots, peas, cabbages and onions, are still very popular.
