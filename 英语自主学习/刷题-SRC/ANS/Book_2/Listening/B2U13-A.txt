    Script: Patience and perseverance will enable us to get whatever we want. When we are faced with different kinds of troubles, we should never give up. Andrea Jung's story is just one about patience and perseverance.
    Andrea Jung is the chairman and CEO of Avon Products. After college, she joined the management training program at Bloomingdale’s. All day everyday, there she was in the stockroom, switching vendor hangers for store hangers on thousands of pieces of clothes. She thought this job was much too boring and really meaningless. So she wanted to quit. When Jung called them about quitting that first job at Bloomingdale’s, her parents told her: "You are not quitting. You start at the bottom and you work your way to the top." "So, I didn’t quit," Jung says. "I persevered, and it ended up being a really terrific run in retail." She devoted herself to the retail for the beauty industry, moving to Avon in 1994. Jung was assigned to create a global Avon brand. She did that so impressively that she was considered for the top job three years later. But she got passed over. And though she wanted to quit, she stayed at last. Two years later, she got the CEO job and became the youngest female chief executive in the Fortune 500.
