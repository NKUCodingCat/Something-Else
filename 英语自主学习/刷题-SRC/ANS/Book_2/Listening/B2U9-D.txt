    Script: Don't let the passage of time steal your dreams away from you. Your dreams are as unique to you as your thumb print. They contribute to the development of your personality and define in a significant way the quality of your life.

    Most of our dreams fall into three categories: Business, Family and Individual Dreams. Early in our childhood or adolescence we dream of becoming a doctor, teacher, nurse, policeman or whatever it is we dream to be. We get an education that leads us into the career we have chosen and we spend a lifetime developing and growing our business skills so we can become the success that we dreamed of becoming.

    Somewhere along the way we dream of having a family. Many of us get married, have children and spend a good portion of our adult life helping our children acquire the education, values and skills that will help them lead happy and successful lives that we dream for them.

    The fact is, the pursuit of our Individual Dreams is as important as our Business and Family Dreams because they define the quality of our lives. At the end of the road, more often than not, we regret what we didn't do, not what we did.

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: When measured against our vast powers, it would be tragic to go through life with little or no ambition. Yet, some seemingly do. Why is that? It is not because of moral decay, but because of ignorance or ineptitude. It is not because of a lack of ambition as much as it is a lack of self-confidence or a lack of direction. Other factors include the fear of failure or the false belief that the sacrifice required to achieve our dream is greater than we can bear. The good news is all of these weaknesses can be overcome. The disgust we have for failing to live up to our potential can inspire us to change.

    Don't be like the young man who went to a guru and said, "Oh Noble One, I lack ambition and am poor as a result. I am sick of my poverty, what shall I do?" Don't get used to your poverty or weaknesses. Instead, use your dissatisfaction as motivation to succeed. Now success doesn't necessarily mean fame and fortune. Rather, it means the achievement of YOUR personal goals. Better to be a poor poet and happy than a rich businessman and frustrated.
