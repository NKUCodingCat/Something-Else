    Section B 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.


    The woman is at a store. She wants to buy some (6)_________________ . The man recommends her a scarf which is made up of (7)_________________ . The woman thinks it looks (8)_________________ , but she would like to have something warm for the (9)_________________ . So the man brings a heavy (10)_________________ , that’s the very one the woman wants to buy. The man says it costs (11)_________________ plus (12)_________________ , but very soon, he offers a (13)_________________ discount. The woman accepts that and asks the man to (14)_________________ it (15)_________________ for her.

    Script: M: Hi, can I help you?
    W: Yes, please. I'm interested in some scarves.
    M: All our scarves are in this section. What do you think of this one here? It's made of silk.
    W: Hm, it looks nice, but I'd like to have something warm for the winter.
    M: Maybe you would like a heavy wool scarf. How about this one?
    W: I think that's what I want. How much is it?
    M: It's...seventy-five dollars plus tax.
    W: It's a little expensive. Do you think it's possible to get a discount?
    M: Hm, since you like it so much, how about a 10 percent discount? That's the best I can offer.

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: How to keep your look up-to-date
    Pick up a women's magazine you normally wouldn't buy. (hint: should have more fashion than recipes on the cover) Elle, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W are good starters.
    Go to a different store (online or physical) and try on new labels, even if the style is similar to what you already own. You may be surprised what you're missing if you rely on certain set merchants and brands.
    Slip in some punchy color. Every season there's a trendy color palette, and it's usually not too hard to figure out what it is. Use color as accent pieces ― a bright scarf, a camisole under a suit.
    Accessories are the easiest ways to update a look. Choose a new handbag, sexy sandals or a new necklace. If you're not sure what's modern, ask a sales associate to point you to what's hot ― they usually know what others are asking for.
    Don't try to radically change your look ― no one in real life ever emerges looking like the "After" picture in a fashion makeover. Make subtle changes over a period of time.
