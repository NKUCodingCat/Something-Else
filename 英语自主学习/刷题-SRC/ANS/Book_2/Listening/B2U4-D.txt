    Script: It hasn't been a good week for Jay-Z. First, he lost Rolling Stone's "King of Hip-Hop" title to Eminem. The pop singer Sabrina said he was "overrated." We've never even heard of Sabrina, but apparently she wrote a song called "I Want to Shoot Lady Gaga."

    “I can tell you who I think is overrated,” Sabrina said, “Jay-Z. Definitely. My fiancé is a huge fan and he quotes lyrics and I'm just like, Dude, that's not even smart.”

    "I miss his old stuff," she continued. "I saw videos of him when he was just starting, when he wasn't really well-known and he can really rap. I didn't realize he could. He always sings off beat, you know? He can really rap but I just wish he could go back to that style that he first started out with. That was hot. What he does now, I don't feel it at all ―I really don't feel him at all."

    Script: Charlie Parker forever changed the performance and writing of jazz music. He developed a new style of jazz called bebop. It was different from the dance, or swing, style that was popular for years. Performers of bebop left the traditional musical melody and played a song freely, with the music and rhythm that was felt at the time. So, the same song could be played in a different way each time it was performed. Charlie Parker said: "Music is your own experience, your thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn."

    Charlie Parker was born August 29th, 1920, in the middle western state of Kansas. He had his first music lessons in the local public schools. His mother bought him a saxophone in 1932. Two years later, he decided to leave school and become a professional musician. For the next four years, he worked mainly in Kansas City, Missouri, where jazz music had become popular. Charlie developed as a musician by playing with different groups in public eating and drinking places called nightclubs. He also learned by listening to older local jazz musicians.
