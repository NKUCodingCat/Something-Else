    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Virtue is a behavior showing a high moral standard and is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral standards. Honesty, loyalty, truthfulness, courage, perseverance, friendliness, kindness, generosity, selflessness, sympathy, charity, thrift, forgiveness, patience, and cooperation are all examples of human virtues.
    How does a person develop virtues? Virtues are developed through learning and through practice. As the ancient philosopher Aristotle suggested, a person can improve his or her character by practicing self-discipline, while a good character can be corrupted by repeated self-indulgence. Just as the ability to run a marathon develops through much training and practice, so too does our capacity to be fair, to be courageous, or to be compassionate. Virtues are habits. That is, once they are acquired, they become characteristic of a person. For example, a person who has developed the virtue of generosity is often referred to as a generous person because he or she tends to be generous in all circumstances. Moreover, a person who has developed virtues will be naturally disposed to act in ways that are consistent with moral principles. A person’s character traits are not developed in isolation, but within and by the communities to which he or she belongs, including family, church, school, and other private and public associations.
