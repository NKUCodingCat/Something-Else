    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: A survey of 5,000 adults asked them to identify as the things that make Britain unique as a nation. Several stereotypical British attributes made the list, including a stiff upper lip, an overriding interest in class and a love of tea. However, less common ideas were also identified, such as a love of all television, looking uncomfortable while dancing and not saying what people mean. Worryingly, getting drunk was also named as a fundamental part of being British.
    Researchers found 58% of people like nothing more than chatting about the forecast. More than 50% also said they are the politest nation when it comes to queuing and 48% considered sarcasm as the highest form of wit. 44% of people said they enjoyed escaping from reality with soap operas. Sixth place went to their love of a bargain, whether it be shopping for discounted products in supermarkets, "buy one get one free" offers or money off coupons. At number seven was their love of curtain twitching with 41 percent of people admitting they could not help adopting the role of the nosy neighbour. Loving trash television, moaning and being obsessed with class all appear in the top ten things which make them "typically British".
