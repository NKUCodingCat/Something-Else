    Script: An early morning crash in Carroll County takes the lives of two teens on Sunday. The accident occurred between two cars on State Road 24, two miles north of Delphi.
    After investigating, police determined that a 1997 Chevy Cavalier, driven by LeAnna Martin, 18, of Logansport, Indiana was headed northbound on State Road 24. Martin had driven left of the center in the roadway, placing her and her passenger, Aubrey Whistler, 17, of Logansport, Indiana head-on into oncoming traffic. A 2004 Lexis, driven by Jeffrey Wittig, 43, of Granger, Indiana was driving southbound on State Road 24 about to hit Martin. Wittig attempted to avoid crashing into Martin’s car by driving off the right side of the roadway, which did not work. Martin’s car hit Wittig’s car almost head-on in the southbound lane, causing Martin’s car to catch fire.
    When police arrived at the scene, they found Martin’s car on fire with the two girls inside the vehicle. The officers and two others who had stopped were able to remove the two from the flaming vehicle. Martin was pronounced dead at the scene and Whistler was transported to IU Arnett in critical condition. She was later flown to IU Methodist in Indianapolis where she later died from her injuries this afternoon. Wittig was transported to St. Elizabeth East with non-life threatening injuries.

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Tornadoes are one of the most deadly and fascinating forces.
    Tornadoes are characterized by violent winds that swirl in a counter clockwise direction north of the equator and clockwise south of the equator. It rotates at speeds up to three hundred miles per hour or in some rare cases, even faster. In the center of the tornado, the air pressure is very low in comparison to surrounding air pressure. The speed of the wind is the primary cause of deaths and destruction of property. Many people are killed by flying objects and missiles. The funnel shaped cloud travels in a skip like movement, and usually never lasts for more than a couple of minutes in any one given place. Certain parts of the world (i.e. Australia, the Midwestern and Southern US) are more prone to have tornadoes. They also occur more frequently in the spring and summer months. Tornadoes usually occur as part of a severe thunderstorm and often come in advance of cold fronts.
    The greatest killer tornado in the United States occurred during the year 1925 in Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. It was the fastest and largest one ever recorded, with a destructive path two hundred and twenty miles long and one mile wide, and traveled at a speed of sixty miles per hour. It killed six hundred ninety five people and injured over two thousand.
