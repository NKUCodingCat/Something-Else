    Section B 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: About the year 1900, a small, dark-haired boy named Charles Chaplin was often seen waiting outside the back entrances of London theatres. He looked thin and hungry but his blue eyes were determined. He was hoping to get work in show business. He could sing and dance. Although his own boyhood was painfully hard, he knew how to make people laugh.
    His own father had died from drinking too much. And his mother was often sick in mind and had to be sent into hospital. When Charles couldn’t get work he wandered about the city streets. He found food and shelter wherever he could. Sometimes he was sent away to a home for children who had no parents.
    About thirty years later, this same Charles Chaplin was accepted the king of comedy. Everyone wanted to meet him. He had become almost a royal figure in the bright new world of the cinema. His most impressive accomplishment was the character of the "little tramp", which Chaplin played in hundreds of films. The poor man made all kinds of stupid mistakes. He was always in trouble. He made us laugh with his crazy attempts to escape his cruel fate. He finds surprising ways out of every difficulty. Even people who don’t understand English can enjoy Chaplin’s films because they are mostly silent. It isn’t what he says that makes us laugh. His comedy depends upon little actions which mean the same thing to people all over the world. Even now, people respect him for his contribution to comedy film.
