    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Welcome to your first weekly exercise challenge and the start of a fitter, healthier lifestyle. The golden rule for any successful exercise program is gradual progression. If you try to do too much too soon, you may lose steam and risk injury. This program enables you to build up your activity level slowly, so the process of getting fitter is enjoyable, safe and, above all, sustainable.
    Today we will talk about walking. Walkers enjoy many of the benefits that people who engage in far more vigorous activities experience. They also have a lower risk of injury, a higher level of adherence and far more opportunities to fit their activity into a busy day. And walking itself is the simplest, most natural form of human movement. You don't need any specific training or specialist equipment, except supportive shoes.
    At this stage, it doesn't matter how fast or slowly you walk, or whether you have to stop to catch your breath. Simply set out for five minutes, turn around and walk back. It's up to you whether you walk on five consecutive days (for example, weekdays) or divide the walks up throughout the week. By the end of this week, you'll have covered somewhere between 5km and 10.5km (3.5 miles and 6.5 miles), depending on your pace, and will have burned as many as 650 calories.
