    Local authorities said the Qujiang and Bahe rivers and their branches have surpassed their warning water level, forcing thousands of people to evacuate. Sichuan police forces have dispatched units to conduct rescue missions, equipped with steam boats and other necessary facilities. Helicopters also stand by to handle possible emergencies. Heavy rains and floods have caused serious damages in Bazhong, Guangyuan and Deyang. In Bazhong City, two people were killed when their houses were collapsed by torrential rain. A mudslide in Nanjiang County buried six houses, leaving five people missing. Flood ravaged low areas of Bazhong City, paralyzing traffic and phone services and causing mudslides. Rice fields were flooded, and part of the crop destroyed.

    Pingchang County of Bazhong City is one of the most affected areas. Flood invaded downtown, leaving the ground floor of houses inundated. 1,320,000 people are affected by the flood in Sichuan as calculated. As heavy rain continues pounding the river valleys, the water level is still rising.

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Flood concerns throughout parts of BC's Central Coast were easing Sunday, after a weekend of heavy rain caused several rivers and streams to swell, breaching banks and flooding several properties.

    By noon on Sunday, residents of about 50 homes along the banks of the Bella Coola River were told they could return home after evacuating on Saturday, according to the Central Coast Regional District. About 40 homes in the community of Hagensborg were evacuated, after more than 220 millimetres of rain fell on the region over three days, said Stephen Waugh, the emergency program co-ordinator with the regional district. Another half dozen homes were evacuated in Walker Island subdivision, and a few homes in Bella Coola had to be abandoned temporarily, he said.

    Flood concerns along the Kingcome and Wannock Rivers, or River's Inlet, have been downgraded. The downgrade means that river levels are less terrible, but could still immediately breach banks. Flood worries on the Bella Coola River also waned since peaking on Friday, Waugh said. The BC River Forecast Centre downgraded its alert on the Bella Coola River. "With moderate precipitation in the forecast, the Bella Coola River is expected to continue to recede and no significant rises are expected," EmergencyInfoBC wrote on its website.
