    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California. While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two created a better system that analyzed the relationships between websites. They called this new technology PageRank, where a website’s relevance was determined by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site. Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine “BackRub”, because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. Eventually, they changed the name to Google, originating from a misspelling of the word “googol”, which means a number followed by one hundred zeros. The word “googol” was selected to signify that the search engine wants to provide large quantities of information for people. Originally, Google ran under the Stanford University website. The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997, and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998. It was based in a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, California. Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee. In May 2011, unique visitors of Google surpassed 1 billion for the first time, an 8.4 percent increase from a year ago with 931 million unique visitors.
