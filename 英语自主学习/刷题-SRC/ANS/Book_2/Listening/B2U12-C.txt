    Script: The Internet is a global system of inter-connected computer networks that use the standard Internet Protocol Suite to serve billions of users worldwide. It consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web and the infrastructure to support electronic mail.
    The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used in everyday speech without much distinction. However, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not one and the same. The hardware and software infrastructure of the Internet establish a global data communications system between computers. In contrast, the Web is one of the services communicated via the Internet. It is a collection of inter-connected documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs.

    Section C 

    Directions: Listen to the passage once and decide whether the following statements are True (T) or False (F).


    Script: Most traditional communications media including telephone, music, film, and television are reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new services. Newspaper, book and other print publishing are adapting to Web site technology. The Internet has enabled new forms of human interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking. The development of information technology has made shopping online possible. Online shopping, which is to conduct the shopping activities online, becomes the hot topic discussed by people.
    The origins of the Internet reach back to research of the 1960s, commissioned by the United States government in collaboration with private commercial interests to build robust, fault-tolerant, and distributed computer networks. The funding of a new U.S. backbone by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. In the 1990s, the Internet successfully merged the majority of previously existing public computer networks. During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%. As of 2009, an estimated one-quarter of Earth’s population uses the services of the Internet.
