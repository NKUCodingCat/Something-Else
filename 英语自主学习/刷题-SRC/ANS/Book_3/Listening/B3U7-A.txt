    Script:         I'm going to a conference this week back in my home state of Minnesota. I am going there to address a convention full of librarians, believe it or not. For me, the worst part of going on the road for business is not the traveling; it's all the preparation you have to do. I created a whole checklist of things I have to do when I travel. First, I confirm that my flight will be on time departing from LAX. Next, I call to double-check on my reservation for the hotel and then rent a car. After that, I pull out my suitcase and start packing. I'm a light packer, so I bring only the pants, shirts, socks, and underwear I'm going to need, nothing more. I throw in my toiletries bag with the usual stuff ? shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss? and then I'm just about done. Finally, I go through my briefcase to make sure I have all the things I'll need for the conference? my badge, my laptop, my overhead transparencies, a notepad, and some pens. Now I'm ready? off I go to my old home.

    Script:         Today, I'm going to give you a brief overview of the trends that are likely to affect our industry in the next 10 years. It's difficult to predict the fads that affect how the general public thinks and behaves. However, by looking at recent polls, we have a good idea about one area that is likely to have a dramatic influence on the way we do business down the line.
            The trend that I'm talking about is the environment. The biggest concern right now across major business industries here and in other parts of the world is about how "going green" will affect company outlook.
            If you'll look at this chart up here, you'll see what the major trend reports are forecasting. The growth of environmentally-friendly products has been off the charts in the past five years, and this trend is likely to continue for at least 10 more years. It's my opinion that it's time we sat up and took notice.

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         I had lunch today with my friend Sue. She recently quit her job with a large company to strike out on her own. The start-up she launched provides technology consulting services for small- to medium-sized companies.
            At first, she wasn't sure if she could raise the seed money she needed for the start-up costs. But, she was able to raise the capital by taking on a silent partner, her uncle, who had a lot of investment capital but didn't want to be involved in the day-to-day operations of a business now that he's retired.
            One way that Sue is able to cut down on overhead is to make this a home-based business. She converted her garage into an office where she and her employees could work. Since most of the work would be done on site at her client's office, she didn't need a lot of office space.
            I asked Sue if she was nervous about quitting her job to start her own business. She said that it's a big risk but that she was looking forward to the challenge. If she fails, she said, she can always audition for American Idol. Well, I thought, I've heard Sue sing. I really hope her business takes off!

    19.
    	
    A) She was not sure about the size of the company.  
    B) She was not certain whether she could raise the fund.  
    C) She was not sure about her office.
