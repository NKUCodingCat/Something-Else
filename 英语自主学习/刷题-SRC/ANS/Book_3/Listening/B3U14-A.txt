    Man: All right. We have to select the criteria for a search. Let's see ... gender ― "female"; location ― "Los Angeles"; age range ― "26 to 35".
    Woman: Wow, you got 243 hits. I think you'd better narrow down the search criteria.
    Man: Okay, I'll search for people who live within a 50-mile radius. That gives us 72 hits.

    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         The Miss World beauty competition is now 60 but remains controversial, as last weekend's show in London proved.
            Inside the venue, about 110 contestants showed off their figures and boasted about their talents. Outside, dozens of feminist campaigners held placards with messages such as "Sexism is pretty ugly" and shouted slogans against what they call the objectification of women.
            Feminists and beauty organisers are old enemies. The show was created in the 1950s to promote the Festival of Britain. By the 70s, Women's Liberation demonstrators tried to stop the competition, saying that the whole thing was an offence against women's equality.
            But some contestants argue that it can actually empower women. Laura Coleman, Miss England 2008, said it "gives girls confidence and opportunities they may not otherwise have."
            For some, these opportunities are in Hollywood. About 12 beauty queens played roles in James Bond movies. Organisers are keen to point out that the contestants not only have attractive appearances but often have degrees and speak several languages.
            This year's winner is 21-year-old Venezuelan Ivian Sarcos, who in her childhood thought about becoming a nun. Despite the protests the show is likely to continue, with plans to hold next year's Miss World in China.

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         I was tired of being single. All of my friends had paired up and I was left hanging. Like everybody else these days, I tried using the Internet to find other singles, but I never had any luck. Looking for my ideal woman among a bunch of lonely hearts is like looking for a needle in a haystack. I needed another strategy.
            I finally hit on a brilliant idea. I would find places where single women naturally get together and simply show up. It may turn out to be a wild goose chase, but I was willing to give it a try.
            That's how I decided to take a jewelry-making class at the community center. I may not know much, but I do know that two things that naturally go together are women and jewelry.
            I got to the class a few minutes late so I could make a grand entrance. But when I walked in, I got the shock of my life. The room was full of single women all right, but not one of them was under the age of 70!
            They were definitely glad to see me. I even received a couple of invitations to dinner that day. But to be honest, that wasn't the kind of dinner date I had been looking for!

    正确答案： B

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Traditionally, when a man invites a woman out on a date, he picks her up at her home, pays all the expenses for the evening, and takes her home at the end of the evening. Before Women's Liberation, the woman was expected to sit at home by the phone and wait and hope for the man of her dreams to call her. Today's liberated woman may take the initiative in suggesting an evening together by inviting a man she likes to a party, to a home-cooked meal, or to an evening at the theatre. If she does the inviting, she pays for at least part of the evening's expenses.
            Today many men working in the U.S.A. have a female boss. Those who come from countries in which the woman's place is still in the home may find it difficult to take orders from a woman. But in the U.S.A, 49% of the work force is female, and many women are judges, doctors, company presidents, college presidents, and entrepreneurs. It is important for men to respect a person who holds a position of responsibility and authority, whether that person is male or female. To treat a woman as inferior just because she is female is not only insulting but also out of step with modern American culture.

    Script:         Among the most profound changes of all is the evidence, tracked by numerous surveys, that as women have gained more freedom, more education and more economic power, they have become less happy. No tidy theory explains the trend, notes University of Pennsylvania economist Justin Wolfers, a co-author of The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness. "We looked across all sectors ― young vs. old, kids or no kids, married or not married, education, no education, working or not working ― and it stayed the same," he says of the data. "But there are a few ways to look at it," he adds. "As Susan Faludi said, the women's movement wasn't about happiness." It may be that women have become more honest about what tortures them. Or that they are now free to struggle with the same pressures and conflicts that once accounted for greater male unhappiness. Or that modern life in a global economy is simply more stressful for everyone but especially for women, who are working longer hours while doing most of the housework at home. "Some of the other social changes that have happened over the last 35 years ― changes in family, in the workplace ― may have affected men differently than women," Wolfers says. "So maybe we're not learning about changes due to the women's movement but changes in society."
            All the shapes in the puzzle are shifting. Equal numbers of men and women report frequent stress in daily life, and most agree that government and businesses have failed to adjust to the changes in the family. As the Old Economy dissolves before our eyes, men and women express remarkably similar life goals when asked about the importance of money, health, jobs and family. If male jobs keep vanishing, if physical strength loses its workplace value, if the premium shifts ever more to education, in which achievement is increasingly female, then we will soon be having parallel conversations: What needs to be done to free American men to realize their full potential? You can imagine the whole conversation flipping in a single generation.
