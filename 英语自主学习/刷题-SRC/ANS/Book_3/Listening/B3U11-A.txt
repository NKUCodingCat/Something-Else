    Script: Man: Hi, Sue, have you started with your research on the homework? You know that literature review on handedness. We are supposed to do the presentation on Thursday next week.
    Woman: Well, I choose to focus on the influence of handedness on sports ― whether in different sports it is better to be left- or right-sided or whether a more balanced approach is more successful.
    Man: That sounds interesting. Did you find interesting data?
    Woman: I happened to start reading an article by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews. He spent the first part of the article talking about handedness in music instead of sport, which I have to say almost put me off from reading further.
    Man: Oh, what happened later?
    Woman: But what I soon became struck by was the sheer volume of both observation and investigation he had done in many different sports and I felt persuaded that what he had to say would be of real interest. I think Matthews' findings will be beneficial．

    Script: Man: Hey, Lola, check this out. It is said that the hand you prefer to use as a ten-week-old fetus is the hand you will favor for the rest of your life!
    Woman: Really? Interesting. Are you saying that handedness is genetically decided?
    Man: This research done by a team from the Queens University in 2010 suggests that it is the case. These scientists, studied the fetuses through scans, and identified sixty fetuses sucking their right thumbs and twelve, their left thumbs.
    Woman: Wow, how exciting! What is the result?
    Man: They followed up these children at the ages of 10-12, and found that all the right thumb sucking fetuses were right-handed children, but about two-thirds of the left thumb sucking fetuses had developed as left-handed children; the others had switched over from left to right!
    Woman: So before we were even born, we have already chosen our preferred hand?
    Man: Afraid so. Turns out that even at 10-15 weeks, when it's too early to be thumb-sucking, the fetuses still wave their arms about; majority appears to move their right arms more. Don't you think it's interesting?

    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Historically, the left side, and as a result left-handedness, was considered negative in many cultures. The Latin word sinistra originally meant "left" but took on meanings of "evil" or "unlucky" by the Classical Latin era, and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, and in the English word "sinister". In many modern European languages, including English, the word for the direction "right" also means "correct" or "proper", and also stands for authority and justice.
            The French word gauche ("left") means clumsy, graceless or awkward, and adroit (related to droit, "right") means "dextrous". These secondary meanings have entered English.
            In Chinese culture, the adjective "left" (pinyin: zuǒ) sometimes means "improper" or "out of accord". For instance, the phrase "left path" (pinyin: zuǒdào) stands for immoral means.

    Script: What does the Chinese adjective "left" sometimes mean?

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Left handers who get an interesting mug on their birthday, will never see the picture on the mug, when they lift it to drink their tea.
            A child I know went to hospital to have an operation, and woke up to find an IV (the medical equipment used to put liquid directly into the body) in his left arm. He was miserable, as he couldn't do any of his drawings while recovering. He was a lefty, and the doctor did not know that.
            A lefty who had ankle surgery, had some problem with the plate and screws used to align the bone, as the screw was bothering him. The doctor asked him to do "friction massage" using a circular motion. This guy did the massage in the wrong direction being a lefty and messed up stuff, so that the doctor had to remove the hardware to save the nerve from the wrong direction massage.
            Even something as simple as playing cards may be a problem. If you fan the cards out naturally left-handed, the numbers disappear!
    15.
    	
    A) He or she would be more than too happy to use the mug.  
    B) He or she would not be able to use the mug.  
    C) He or she would give the mug to other friends.

    Script: What may happen to a left-handed person who has received a birthday mug?

    正确答案： D
    16.

    B) The numbers on the cards may seem to disappear.

    D) He missed the family.  
    Script: Why was the child in hospital miserable?

    正确答案： C

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         One in every 10 people is left-handed, and males are one and a half times more likely to be left-handed than females, according to Left-handers International Statistics. French researchers at the Montpelier University indicate that left-handed people are more likely to be alcoholic, criminal, dyslexic, and have mental disabilities. As if that's not bad enough, they're also more likely to die young and get into accidents.
            But this ability to "be different" has its own benefits. Particularly in sports. Babe Ruth in baseball, and of course John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova in tennis. You name a one-on-one sport, and one can point out left-handed sportsmen who were masters in their field.
            Is being a lefty an advantage? Some French researchers think so. Since right-handed folks are a majority, for a lefty to fight with a right-handed person would be a predictable thing. Easy.
            However, for right handed types, fighting suddenly with a left handed warrior would be a surprise factor, and would need some time getting used to.
    18.
    	
    A) 10%.  
    B) 20%.  
    C) 30%.

    C) Males and females have the similar proportion.  
    D) Males and females are equal in number.  
    Script: What is the gender difference in terms of handedness?

    正确答案： B
    20.

    B) In sports.  
    C) In music.  
    D) In writing.  
    Script: In which filed does being left-handed have its benefits?

    Script:         I have a nephew who was born and spent the first 25 years of his life in India. Somewhere around the time he was 6-7 months, his grandmother's sharp eye noticed his distinct preference for the "wrong hand". In India, hands and their usage in everyday life are sacred, essential and cannot be violated. The left hand is used for activities related to getting rid of body waste and cleaning oneself thereafter. The right hand is used for eating, conducting prayer activities, intellectual activities and the like. They had a family discussion. Twenty years ago, this would have been a crisis situation with people designing drastic ways and means to get the kid to turn right-handed. Luckily, better sense prevailed, and the child was allowed to grow up with his natural tendency.
            Then one fine day, when he was eight, a special teacher was selected to come teach the child the Indian instrument, the "tabla". The teacher was shocked. The tabla consisted of two differently pitched drums, and the main one, the actual tabla, MUST be played with the right hand. Strong will prevailed over the boy's natural tendencies, and to this day, 20 years later, the boy plays the tabla, right-handed.
