    Section B 

    Direstions：Listen to three short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. All the recordings will be played once only. After you hear a question, please choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).


    Passage One
    Questions 12 to 14 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Studies have shown that men and women deal with stress differently. Women usually have stronger social support systems to help them in times of trouble. These social supports may help explain why many women seem to be better able to deal with stress than men are. However, experts say women are three times more likely to develop depression in reaction to the stress in their lives.
            American writer John Gray became famous for his book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. The book explored the effect of biological differences between men and women on their personal relationships.
            Mr. Gray says one major difference is the way people react to a certain hormone. The body releases this hormone to deal with stressful situations. Mr. Gray says studies have linked a rise in this hormone to reduced stress in men. But the same level of the hormone has no such effect on women.
            He notes that men and women have opposite ways of dealing with stress. For a man, the best way is to rest and forget about daily problems. But a woman suffering from stress needs to talk about her problems. Talking leads to the release of the brain hormone chemicals, which lowers her stress levels.

    Script: What is the best way for a man to deal with stress?

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Chronic stress lasts a long time or happens often. Chronic stress causes the body to produce too much of two hormones, cortisol and adrenalin. Cortisol is called the "worry" hormone. It is produced when we are afraid. Adrenalin prepares the body to react physically to a threat.
            Persons suffering from chronic stress produce too much of these hormones for too long. Too much cortisol and adrenalin can result in physical problems and changes that lead to stress-related sickness.
            Cortisol provides high levels of energy during important periods. However, scientists have become concerned about the hormone's long-term effects on our health. Evidence shows that extended periods of cortisol in the body weakens bones, damages nerve cells in the brain and weakens the body's defense system against disease. This makes it easier to get viral and bacterial infections.
            Chronic stress has been linked to high blood pressure and heart disease. Studies suggest that people who are easily stressed develop blockages in blood passageways faster than other people.

    Script: What does the study say about chronic stress?

    正确答案： A

    Passage Three
    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         Stress is a reaction, physical, mental, or emotional, to demands or changes in your life. Everyone is affected by stressful situations. It is easy to acknowledge that a major life change, such as losing one's job or a death in the family, causes stress. One can also "be stressed" with an accumulation of daily pressures, such as long commutes in traffic, a tight work schedule, or disagreements with coworkers or family members. Your stress may be apparent to you and everyone else around you, or it may be hidden.
            Stress, if continuous, can affect your physical, mental, and emotional well-being.
            When confronted by an alarming situation, our brain releases adrenaline and other chemicals which cause our heart rate and blood pressure to increase (moving blood to our muscles and brain), our breathing to become faster, our digestion to slow down, and we feel a sudden rush of energy.
            When we feel that the danger has passed, our brain stops producing the chemicals that cause the physical reactions, and our bodies return to their normal state. If we continue to react to the event, even after the event has passed, then our minds and our bodies stay in a state of alarm. If this state of tension is maintained, it can contribute to minor health problems and is thought to be associated with other more serious diseases.
    18.
    	
    A) Physical well-being.  
    B) Mental well-being.  
    C) Emotional well-being.  
    D) Biological functions.

    19.
    	
    A) Our heart rate and blood pressure will decrease.  
    B) Our breathing becomes slow.

    D) We feel a sudden rush of energy.  
    Script: When confronted by an alarming situation, what will happen to our body?

    20.

    B) It is thought to cause minor diseases.  
    C) It may result in bad temper.

When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

    Script:         What would you do when you are under work pressure, "stressed out and frantic" or "challenged and energized"? The following are ways to perform better under pressure suggested:
            No.1 Think of a heavy work load as an exciting opportunity to push yourself, learn new skills and show your courage. Complaining depletes your energy; instead greet an overloaded day with optimism. Tell yourself, "This is a challenge I am capable of handling."
            No.2 Tackle your fears. Pressure doesn't paralyze you, fear does. Often, your stress comes from worrying rather than from the work assignment or problem you're struggling with. For example, worried about a presentation because you've never spoken in front of a group of people, don't know what to wear and the slide projector isn't working correctly? So, you should write down these fears and methodically address each one.
            No.3 Alternate tasks. Blocking out an entire day or week for a high-priority project increases your anxiety without boosting your productivity. In fact, you may lose perspective. You need to create a rhythm to your work to recharge. Every 60 to 90 minutes, take a break from your primary activity and do something different for 15 minutes.
            No.4 Shake a leg and straighten up your desk. Regular exercise is critical to stress management. Don't neglect some exercise which you can actually do every day, such as walk to your or someone's office, instead of taking the elevator; stand up and stretch your back and neck muscles while you are on the phone, and so on. Tiding your desk is one of the most common, effective ways to calm and focus energy. Organizing helps people reduce tension and get into a productive frame of mind.
            No.5 Arrangeliving lifestyle. Get six to eight hours of sleep, and go to bed at the same hour every night. Avoid big meals and eat low-fat snacks every hour.
