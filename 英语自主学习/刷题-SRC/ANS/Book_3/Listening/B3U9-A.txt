    Passage One

    Script:         In my family, there are penny-savers and spendthrifts, and everything in between. My brother Frank has the reputation for being stingy with money.

            On the other hand, my brother Jack is known as a spendthrift. It's not that he's a big spender. It's just that he's not very careful with money and doesn't think it's that important. When he has money, he doesn't think twice about spending it. With his friends, he's extremely generous.

    Passage Two
    Questions 15 to 17 are based on the passage you have just heard.

    Script:         The currency of Euro was introduced in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued to be used as legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.
            The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from several years to forever (the latter in Austria, Germany, Ireland and Spain). The earliest coins to become non-convertible were the Portuguese escudos, which ceased to have monetary value after 31 December 2002, although banknotes remain exchangeable until 2022.

    Questions 18 to 20 are based on the passage you have just heard.

            The name "euro" was officially adopted in Madrid on 16 December 1995. Belgian Esperantist Germain Pirlot, a former teacher of French and history is credited of naming the new currency by sending a letter to then President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, suggesting the name "euro" on 4 August 1995.
            The rates of Euros were determined by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would equal one euro.

When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

    Script:         At the second eurozone summit, European leaders failed again to deliver a convincing and definitive rescue package designed to prevent the eurozone debt crisis from getting worse, analysts said. Many eurozone countries seem to hope that China and other emerging economies might come to the rescue.
            Stabilizing the eurozone is in China's interest since Europe is China's biggest export market, and China has repeatedly expressed its confidence that the EU countries have the wisdom and ability to eventually tide over the crisis.
            However, whether China should offer a helping hand would depend on what the rescue package is like, said Xiong Hou, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top Chinese think tank.
            "What if it happens again in the future? What if other countries follow in the footsteps of Greece? Many people would ask why we should step into the mess," Xiong said, "The key to the debt crisis and the lifeline of the European economy are in the hands of Europeans themselves, rather than China."
            It would be unacceptable to let a developing country like China pay the bills while Europeans sit idle. "It is just like a big hole was created by someone, but somebody else is asked to fill it," Xiong said.
