            Rather than saying they would forgive that I hadn’t   21    thanked them, instead, for Pete’s sake, they were thanking me ― for having remembered, for having considered they had done anything so   22    .
            Always the college professor, my dad had carefully avoided anything he considered too   23    , so I knew how moved he was to write me that, after having helped educate many young people, he now felt that his best results included his own son.
            The Reverend Nelson wrote that his   24    as a “simple, old-fashioned principal” had ended with schools undergoing such swift changes that he had retired in self-doubt. “I heard more of what I had done wrong than what I did right,” he said, adding that my letter had brought him welcome   25    that his career had been appreciated.
            A glance at Grandma’s   26    handwriting brought back in a flash memories of standing alongside her white rocking chair, watching her “settin’ down” some letter to relatives.   27    , Grandma would slowly   28    one word, then the next, so that a finished page would   29    hours.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Four weeks ago US children dressed as monsters and asked for sweets. That was Halloween. In a few weeks American houses will be red and green and filled with presents. For Christmas．
            As if all this isn’t enough, on Thursday this week, America will enjoy another festival ― Thanksgiving．
            Children will have two days off school, shops will close and houses will be filled with families enjoying mountains of food．
            Every year, in Gainesville, Florida, all entire class celebrate Thanksgiving together．The class dresses up and puts on plays for their families. After the plays the families share a feast of traditional Thanksgiving foods like turkey and pumpkin pie．
            Dean Foster, an 11-year-old boy will take part in this celebration. He said: “I love Thanksgiving because it means time off school, lots of nice food and a happy family.”
            His brother Ben, nine, said: “The best thing about Thanksgiving，is that when it is finished, it is time to start Christmas.”
            But behind the food and the large amount of money spent there is another message. On Thursday evening, Dean and Ben’ s family will make a basket and put it on the table as they eat their evening meal．
            Each of them will write a list of things that they are thankful for and place the paper in the basket. The family will read the pieces of paper and take time to thank God and each other for providing them with comfortable and happy lives．
            Thanksgiving is a traditional festival that started in 1621, when the first pilgrims arrived in the US to start a new life. After a hard year, they had a big autumn harvest. They held a feast and invited the native American Indians along to thank God for giving them enough food．In time, other colonies began to celebrate a day of thanksgiving. But it took years before there was a national Thanksgiving Day. During the Civil War, Sarah Josepha Hale persuaded Abraham Lincoln to do something about it. He proclaimed the last Thursday of November 1863 as a day of thanksgiving. Today, Americans celebrate this happy harvest festival on the fourth Thursday in November.
            Many countries celebrate Thanksgiving. They often fall after the fields have been harvested and the crops collected for winter．

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            There is a new type of advertisement becoming increasingly common in newspaper classified columns. It is sometimes placed among "situations vacant", although it doesn't offer anyone job, and sometimes it appears "situations wanted", although it is not placed by someone looking for a job either. What is done is to offer help in applying for a job.
            "Contact us before writing your application", or "Make use of our long experience in preparing your curriculum vitae (工作简历) or job history", is how it is usually expressed. The growth and apparent success of such a specialized service is, of course, a reflection on the current high levels of unemployment. It is also an indication of the growing importance of the curriculum vitae (or job history), with the suggestion that it may now qualify as an art form in its own right.
    There was a time when job seeker simply wrote letters of application. "Just put down your name, address, age and whether you have passed any exams" was about the average level of advice offer distributed to young people applying for their first jobs when they left school. The letter was really just for openers, it was explained, and everything else could and should be saved for the interview. And in those days of full employment the technique worked. The letter proved that you could write and were available for work. Your eager face and intelligent replies did the rest.
            Later, as you moved up the ladder, something slightly more sophisticated was called for. The advice then was to put something in the letter, which would distinguish you from the rest. It might be the aggressive approach. "Your search is over. I am the person you are looking for, " was a widely used trick that occasionally succeeded. Or it might be some special feature specially designed for the job interview.
            There is no doubt, however, that it is the increasing number of applicants with university education at all points in the process of engaging staff that has led to the greater importance of the curriculum vitae.



    36.

    A) informs job hunters of the opportunities available  
    B) promises useful advice to those looking for employment  
    C) divides available jobs into various types  
    D) informs employers that people are available for work  

    正确答案： B
    37.
    	
    Nowadays a demand for this specialized type of service has been created because _______.
    A) there is a lack of jobs available for artistic people  
    B) there are so many top-level job available  
    C) there are so many people out of work  
    D) the job history is considered to be a work of art  

    正确答案： C
    38.

    A) write a initial letter giving their life history  
    B) pass some exams before applying for a job  
    C) have no qualifications other than being able to read and write  
    D) keep any detailed information until they obtained an interview  

    正确答案： D
    39.
