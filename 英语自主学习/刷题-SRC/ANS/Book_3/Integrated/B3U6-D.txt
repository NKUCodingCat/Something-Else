            Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them. He was past sixty and had a long white beard curling down over his chest.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            It is the last day of the school year and I stand empty-handed with no gift to give you.
            It isn’t that I haven’t tried to think of something meaningful and special … quite to the contrary. For months, I have combed catalogs, browsed speciality shops and department stores, and even searched the Internet only to realize that nothing could measure up to the feelings of a mother’s grateful heart and a teacher’s loving dedication.
            How I wish a colorful bundle of fresh wildflowers could reflect the beauty of your way with children ― the constant patience and nurturing, the gentle encouragement. Jewelry would surely be nice, but what can I afford that would not soon tarnish and grow quickly out of style? You deserve the gems of royalty for your determination and creativity, your devotion and talent. During the past year, I have given you many small gifts, mostly intangible ones.
            At the moment the first school bell rang last August, I placed in you my trust, believing you would teach my child and reserve respect for me as a parent. I added to that my constant and devoted prayers that you would be objective and fair to set limitations while offering my child a chance to learn self-control and to soar a bit in the process. I sincerely petitioned that your classroom would be a safe shelter for my child to grow and learn, which is a perfect mixture of self-discipline and controlled instruction. I prayed for your health and your happiness, and your ability to be supplied with the tools necessary to complete your task as teacher and educator. I offered you my time as often as I could, and my support for your cause. Occasionally, I even offered you a challenge when I spoke my mind, sometimes standing firm, sometimes giving up with a renewed assurance or a “wait and see” attitude!
            I wish with all my heart I could put a delicate ribbon on a wrapped package and give you a “something” to express my appreciation and affection, but I have nothing to give you that would surpass the most precious gift I have ever had to offer and which you already so pleasantly accepted months ago ― the one you have held close to your heart, laughed with and probably cried with, applauded and scolded, encouraged and molded ― my child!
            And today, as my child returns to my side for the summer, the gift I humbly give to you is found deep within my heart …
            I give to you my thanks.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            I am an impatient man, so you may understand how I might respond to a roadblock. It happened in a mountain road to California. A young man stopped me at a barricade to tell me there would be a half-hour delay. In the next five minutes, I nervously put my hands on the file cases, records and so on. Cars were lining up behind me, and drivers began getting out of them. So did I. "It's a beautiful morning", an elderly man joined me at the roadside. I looked around strings of mist through the mountain tracing silver lines against the sky. There was a clean snap of autumn in the air.
            Later small groups of motorists had gathered along the roadside up the line. Someone took pictures. The delay became an event. It was that way during the last flood in my neighborhood, when the road was cut and power gone. People came out of their houses to talk. Others shared wine by lantern light and cooked over fireplaces.
            What does it take to get us talking? What does it take to bring us together, grabbing at the small alliances that form when the wind howls or when the traffic stops? We have so little time for one other.
            I heard a voice coming over the barricade attendant's walkie-talkie "OK" he said "the road's clear". I glanced at my watch, fifty-five minutes has passed. I couldn't believe I had remained still that long without going mad.
