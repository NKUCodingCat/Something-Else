            Rather than saying they would forgive that I hadn’t   21    thanked them, instead, for Pete’s sake, they were thanking me ― for having remembered, for having considered they had done anything so   22    .
            Always the college professor, my dad had carefully avoided anything he considered too   23    , so I knew how moved he was to write me that, after having helped educate many young people, he now felt that his best results included his own son.
            The Reverend Nelson wrote that his   24    as a “simple, old-fashioned principal” had ended with schools undergoing such swift changes that he had retired in self-doubt. “I heard more of what I had done wrong than what I did right,” he said, adding that my letter had brought him welcome   25    that his career had been appreciated.
            A glance at Grandma’s   26    handwriting brought back in a flash memories of standing alongside her white rocking chair, watching her “settin’ down” some letter to relatives.   27    , Grandma would slowly   28    one word, then the next, so that a finished page would   29    hours.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Throughout the nation’s more than 15,000 school districts widely differing approaches to teaching science and math have emerged. Though there can be strength in diversity, a new international analysis suggests that this variability has instead contributed to lackluster (平淡的) achievement scores by U.S. children relative to their peers in other developed countries.
            Indeed, concludes William H. Schmidt of Michigan State University, who led the new analysis, “no single intellectually coherent vision dominates U.S. educational practice in math or science.” The reason, he said, “is because the system is deeply and fundamentally flawed.”
            The new analysis, released this week by the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va., is based on data collected from about 50 nations as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.
            Not only do approaches to teaching science and math vary among individual U.S. communities, the report finds, but there appears to be little strategic focus within a school district’s curricula, its textbooks, or its teachers’ activities. This contrasts sharply with the coordinated national programs of most other countries.
            On average, U.S. students study more topics within science and math than their international counterparts do. This creates an educational environment that “is a mile wide and an inch deep,” Schmidt notes.
            For instance, eighth graders in the United States cover about 33 topics in math versus just 19 in Japan. Among science courses, the international gap is even wider. U.S. curricula for this age level resemble those of a small group of countries including Australia, Thailand, Iceland, and Bulgaria. Schmidt asks whether the United States wants to be classed with these nations, whose educational systems “share our pattern of splintered (支离破碎的) visions” but which are not economic leaders.
            The new report “couldn’t come at a better time,” says Gerald Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association in Arlington. “The new National Science Education Standards provide that focused vision,” including the call “to do less, but in greater depth.”
            Implementing the new science standards and their math counterparts will be the challenge, he and Schmidt agree, because the decentralized responsibility for education in the United States requires that any reforms be tailored and instituted one community at a time.
            In fact, Schmidt argues, reforms such as these proposed national standards "face an almost impossible task, because even though they are intellectually coherent, each becomes only one more voice in the babble (嘈杂声)."

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Four weeks ago US children dressed as monsters and asked for sweets. That was Halloween. In a few weeks American houses will be red and green and filled with presents. For Christmas．
            As if all this isn’t enough, on Thursday this week, America will enjoy another festival ― Thanksgiving．
            Children will have two days off school, shops will close and houses will be filled with families enjoying mountains of food．
            Every year, in Gainesville, Florida, all entire class celebrate Thanksgiving together．The class dresses up and puts on plays for their families. After the plays the families share a feast of traditional Thanksgiving foods like turkey and pumpkin pie．
            Dean Foster, an 11-year-old boy will take part in this celebration. He said: “I love Thanksgiving because it means time off school, lots of nice food and a happy family.”
            His brother Ben, nine, said: “The best thing about Thanksgiving，is that when it is finished, it is time to start Christmas.”
            But behind the food and the large amount of money spent there is another message. On Thursday evening, Dean and Ben’ s family will make a basket and put it on the table as they eat their evening meal．
            Each of them will write a list of things that they are thankful for and place the paper in the basket. The family will read the pieces of paper and take time to thank God and each other for providing them with comfortable and happy lives．
            Thanksgiving is a traditional festival that started in 1621, when the first pilgrims arrived in the US to start a new life. After a hard year, they had a big autumn harvest. They held a feast and invited the native American Indians along to thank God for giving them enough food．In time, other colonies began to celebrate a day of thanksgiving. But it took years before there was a national Thanksgiving Day. During the Civil War, Sarah Josepha Hale persuaded Abraham Lincoln to do something about it. He proclaimed the last Thursday of November 1863 as a day of thanksgiving. Today, Americans celebrate this happy harvest festival on the fourth Thursday in November.
            Many countries celebrate Thanksgiving. They often fall after the fields have been harvested and the crops collected for winter．
