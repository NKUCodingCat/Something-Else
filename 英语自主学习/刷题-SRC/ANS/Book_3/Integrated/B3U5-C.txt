            Rather than saying they would forgive that I hadn’t   21    thanked them, instead, for Pete’s sake, they were thanking me ― for having remembered, for having considered they had done anything so   22    .
            Always the college professor, my dad had carefully avoided anything he considered too   23    , so I knew how moved he was to write me that, after having helped educate many young people, he now felt that his best results included his own son.
            The Reverend Nelson wrote that his   24    as a “simple, old-fashioned principal” had ended with schools undergoing such swift changes that he had retired in self-doubt. “I heard more of what I had done wrong than what I did right,” he said, adding that my letter had brought him welcome   25    that his career had been appreciated.
            A glance at Grandma’s   26    handwriting brought back in a flash memories of standing alongside her white rocking chair, watching her “settin’ down” some letter to relatives.   27    , Grandma would slowly   28    one word, then the next, so that a finished page would   29    hours.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Public distrust of scientists stems in part from the blurring of boundaries between science and technology, between discovery and manufacture. Most governments, perhaps all governments, justify public expenditure on scientific research in terms of the economic benefits the scientific enterprise has brought in the past and will bring in the future. Politicians remind their voters of the splendid machines “our scientists” have invented. At the same time, the politicians demand of scientists that they tailor their research to “economics needs”, that they award a higher priority to research proposals that are “near the market” and can be translated into the greatest return on investment in the shortest time. Dependent, as they are, on politicians for much of their funding, scientists have little choice but to comply. Like the rest of us, they are members of a society that rates the creation of wealth as the greatest possible good. Many have reservations, but keep them to themselves in what they perceive as a climate hostile to the pursuit of understanding for its own sake and the idea of an inquiring, creative spirit.
            In such circumstances no one should be too hard on people who are suspicious of conflicts of interest. When we learn that the distinguished professor assuring us of the safety of a particular product holds a consultancy with the company making it, we cannot be blamed for wondering whether his fee might conceivably cloud his professional judgment. Even if the professor holds no consultancy with any firm, some people many still distrust him because of his association with those who do, or at least wonder about the source of some of his research funding.
            This attitude can have damaging effects. It questions the integrity of individuals working in a profession that prizes intellectual honesty as the supreme virtue, and plays into the hands of those who would like to discredit scientists by representing them as venal (可以收买的). This makes it easier to dismiss all scientific pronouncements, but especially those made by the scientists who present themselves as “experts”. The scientist most likely to understand the safety of a nuclear reactor, for example, is a nuclear engineer who declares that a reactor is unsafe, and we believe him, because clearly it is not to his advantage to lie about it. If he tells us it is safe, on the other hand, we distrust him, because he may well be protecting the employer who pays his salary.

    31.
    	
    What is the chief concern of most governments when it comes to scientific research?
    A) The creativity of scientists.  
    B) The reduction of public expenditure.  
    C) Quick economic returns.  
    D) The budget for a research project.  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    Scientists have to tailor their research to “economic needs” in order to ________.
    A) win more awards  
    B) put theories into practice more efficiently  
    C) obtain funding from the government  
    D) pursue knowledge for knowledge’s sake  

    正确答案： C
    33.
    	
    Why won’t scientists complain about the government’s policy concerning scientific research?
    A) They think they work in an environment hostile to the free pursuit of knowledge.  
    B) They are accustomed to keeping their opinions to themselves.  
    C) They know it takes patience to win support from the public.  
    D) They think compliance with government policy is in the interests of the public.  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    According to the author, people are suspicious of the professional judgment of scientists because ________.
    A) their pronouncements often turn out to be wrong  
    B) sometimes they hide the source of their research funding  
    C) some of them do not give priority to intellectual honesty  
    D) they could be influenced by their association with the project concerned  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    What damaging effects can public distrust of scientists have?
    A) Governments may spend less research funds on scientific research.  
    B) People may doubt the intellectual honesty and the statements of the so-called experts.  
    C) It may dampen the enthusiasm of scientists for independent research.  
    D) Scientists themselves may doubt the value of their research findings.  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            I’d heard about the feel-good benefits of a gratitude attitude. Hoping for tips, I called professor Emmons, who pioneered research on the benefits of positive thinking. Emmons quoted new studies that indicated that even pretending to be thankful raises levels of the chemicals associated with pleasure and contentment. He recommended keeping a log of everything I’m grateful for in a given week or month.
            I followed his suggestions, but my first attempts at keeping a gratitude list were pretty weak: coffee, naps, caffeine in general. As my list grew, I found more uplift: freshly picked blueberries; the Beatles’ White Album; that I’m not bald.
            By day three, I was on a tear, thanking every grocery bagger and parent on the playground like I’d just won an Oscar and hanging post-it notes to remind myself of the next day’s thank-you targets: the mailman, my son’s math teacher. But soon, the full-on approach started to bum me out. Researchers call it the Pledge of Allegiance effect. “If you overdo gratitude, it loses its meaning or, worse, becomes a chore,” professor Emmons told me when I mentioned my slump. Be selective, he advised, and focus on thanking the unsung heroes in your life.
            Then professor Emmons suggested a “gratitude visit.” Think of a person who has made a major difference in your life and whom you’ve never properly thanked. Compose a detailed letter to him or her that expresses your appreciation in concrete terms, then read it aloud, face-to-face.
            I immediately flashed on Miss Riggi, my eighth-grade English teacher. She was the first one to open my eyes to Hemingway, Faulkner, and other literary giants. To this day, I am guided by her advice (“Never be boring”). I booked plane tickets to my hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania.
            Miss Riggi was shorter than I remember, though unmistakable with her still long, black hair and bright, intelligent eyes. After a slightly awkward hug and small talk, we settled in. I took a deep breath and read.
            And whether it was Miss Riggi’s enormous smile when I finished the letter, or the way she held it close as we said goodbye, my feeling of peace and joy remained long after I returned home.
            Since then, I have written several more gratitude letters, and my wife and I both summon our “training” when we feel saddled by life. The unpleasant matters are still there, but appreciation, I’ve learned, has an echo ― and it’s loud enough to drown out the grumbling of one man emptying the dishwasher.

    36.
    	
    According to the passage, what did professor Emmons propose to have a gratitude attitude?
    A) Making oneself appear to be grateful.  
    B) Keeping an elaborate diary.  
    C) Thinking positively in a given time.  
    D) Recording everything appreciated for a certain time.  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    According to the context, “gratitude visit” in Para. 4 refers to ________.
    A) inviting someone out of appreciation  
    B) calling on someone with an appreciated letter
