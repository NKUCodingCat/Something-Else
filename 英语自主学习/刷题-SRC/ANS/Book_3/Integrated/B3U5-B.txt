            Rather than saying they would forgive that I hadn’t   21    thanked them, instead, for Pete’s sake, they were thanking me ― for having remembered, for having considered they had done anything so   22    .
            Always the college professor, my dad had carefully avoided anything he considered too   23    , so I knew how moved he was to write me that, after having helped educate many young people, he now felt that his best results included his own son.
            The Reverend Nelson wrote that his   24    as a “simple, old-fashioned principal” had ended with schools undergoing such swift changes that he had retired in self-doubt. “I heard more of what I had done wrong than what I did right,” he said, adding that my letter had brought him welcome   25    that his career had been appreciated.
            A glance at Grandma’s   26    handwriting brought back in a flash memories of standing alongside her white rocking chair, watching her “settin’ down” some letter to relatives.   27    , Grandma would slowly   28    one word, then the next, so that a finished page would   29    hours.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            I’d heard about the feel-good benefits of a gratitude attitude. Hoping for tips, I called professor Emmons, who pioneered research on the benefits of positive thinking. Emmons quoted new studies that indicated that even pretending to be thankful raises levels of the chemicals associated with pleasure and contentment. He recommended keeping a log of everything I’m grateful for in a given week or month.
            I followed his suggestions, but my first attempts at keeping a gratitude list were pretty weak: coffee, naps, caffeine in general. As my list grew, I found more uplift: freshly picked blueberries; the Beatles’ White Album; that I’m not bald.
            By day three, I was on a tear, thanking every grocery bagger and parent on the playground like I’d just won an Oscar and hanging post-it notes to remind myself of the next day’s thank-you targets: the mailman, my son’s math teacher. But soon, the full-on approach started to bum me out. Researchers call it the Pledge of Allegiance effect. “If you overdo gratitude, it loses its meaning or, worse, becomes a chore,” professor Emmons told me when I mentioned my slump. Be selective, he advised, and focus on thanking the unsung heroes in your life.
            Then professor Emmons suggested a “gratitude visit.” Think of a person who has made a major difference in your life and whom you’ve never properly thanked. Compose a detailed letter to him or her that expresses your appreciation in concrete terms, then read it aloud, face-to-face.
            I immediately flashed on Miss Riggi, my eighth-grade English teacher. She was the first one to open my eyes to Hemingway, Faulkner, and other literary giants. To this day, I am guided by her advice (“Never be boring”). I booked plane tickets to my hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania.
            Miss Riggi was shorter than I remember, though unmistakable with her still long, black hair and bright, intelligent eyes. After a slightly awkward hug and small talk, we settled in. I took a deep breath and read.
            And whether it was Miss Riggi’s enormous smile when I finished the letter, or the way she held it close as we said goodbye, my feeling of peace and joy remained long after I returned home.
            Since then, I have written several more gratitude letters, and my wife and I both summon our “training” when we feel saddled by life. The unpleasant matters are still there, but appreciation, I’ve learned, has an echo ― and it’s loud enough to drown out the grumbling of one man emptying the dishwasher.

    31.
    	
    According to the passage, what did professor Emmons propose to have a gratitude attitude?
    A) Making oneself appear to be grateful.  
    B) Keeping an elaborate diary.  
    C) Thinking positively in a given time.  
    D) Recording everything appreciated for a certain time.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Four weeks ago US children dressed as monsters and asked for sweets. That was Halloween. In a few weeks American houses will be red and green and filled with presents. For Christmas．
            As if all this isn’t enough, on Thursday this week, America will enjoy another festival ― Thanksgiving．
            Children will have two days off school, shops will close and houses will be filled with families enjoying mountains of food．
            Every year, in Gainesville, Florida, all entire class celebrate Thanksgiving together．The class dresses up and puts on plays for their families. After the plays the families share a feast of traditional Thanksgiving foods like turkey and pumpkin pie．
            Dean Foster, an 11-year-old boy will take part in this celebration. He said: “I love Thanksgiving because it means time off school, lots of nice food and a happy family.”
            His brother Ben, nine, said: “The best thing about Thanksgiving，is that when it is finished, it is time to start Christmas.”
            But behind the food and the large amount of money spent there is another message. On Thursday evening, Dean and Ben’ s family will make a basket and put it on the table as they eat their evening meal．
            Each of them will write a list of things that they are thankful for and place the paper in the basket. The family will read the pieces of paper and take time to thank God and each other for providing them with comfortable and happy lives．
            Thanksgiving is a traditional festival that started in 1621, when the first pilgrims arrived in the US to start a new life. After a hard year, they had a big autumn harvest. They held a feast and invited the native American Indians along to thank God for giving them enough food．In time, other colonies began to celebrate a day of thanksgiving. But it took years before there was a national Thanksgiving Day. During the Civil War, Sarah Josepha Hale persuaded Abraham Lincoln to do something about it. He proclaimed the last Thursday of November 1863 as a day of thanksgiving. Today, Americans celebrate this happy harvest festival on the fourth Thursday in November.
            Many countries celebrate Thanksgiving. They often fall after the fields have been harvested and the crops collected for winter．
