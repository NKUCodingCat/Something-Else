            But no; with all this "security", we are perhaps the most   22    nation in the history of   23    man. What better word to   24    the way in which we have been forced to live? What sadder   25    on all that we have become in this new and puzzling time?
            We trust no one.   26    housewives wear rape whistles on their station wagon key chains. We have become so smart about self-protection that, in the end, we have all   27    ourselves. We may have locked the evils out, but in so doing we have locked ourselves in.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            In the villages of the English countryside there are still people who remember the good old days when no one bothered to lock their doors. There simply wasn’t any crime to worry about.
            Amazingly, these happy times appear still to be with us in the world’s biggest community. A new study by Dan Farmer, a gifted programmer, using an automated investigative program of his own called SATAN, shows that the owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up homes without fitting locks to their doors.
            SATAN can try out a variety of well-known hacking (黑客的) tricks on an Internet site without actually breaking in. Farmer has made the program publicly available, amid much criticism. A person with evil intent could use it to hunt down sites that are easy to burgle (闯入……行窃).
            But Farmer is very concerned about the need to alert the public to poor security and, so far, events have proved him right. SATAN has done more to alert people to the risks than cause new disorder.
            So is the Net becoming more secure? Far from it. In the early days, when you visited a Web site your browser simply looked at the content. Now the Web is full of tiny programs that automatically download when you look at a Web page, and run on your own machine. These programs could, if their authors wished, do all kinds of nasty things to your computer.
            At the same time, the Net is increasingly populated with spiders, worms, agents and other types of automated beasts designed to penetrate the sites and seek out and classify information. All these make wonderful tools for antisocial people who want to invade weak sites and cause damage.
            But let’s look on the bright side. Given the lack of locks, the Internet is surely the world’s biggest (almost) crime-free society. Maybe that is because hackers are fundamentally honest. Or that there currently isn’t much to steal. Or because vandalism (恶意破坏) isn’t much fun unless you have a peculiar dislike for someone.
            Whatever the reason, let’s enjoy it while we can. But expect it all to change, and security to become the number one issue, when the most influential inhabitants of the Net are selling services they want to be paid for.

    31.
    	
    By saying "... owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up home without fitting locks to their doors" (Para. 2), the author means that _____.
    A) those happy times appear still to be with us  
    B) the Internet is surely the world’s biggest crime-free society  
    C) many sites are not well-protected  
    D) the Internet is immune to hacking tricks  

    正确答案： C
    32.

    A) to investigate the security of Internet sites  
    B) to improve the security of the Internet system  
    C) to imitate hackers by pretending to break into websites  
    D) to provide the hacking program for the public  

    正确答案： A
    33.
    	
    Farmer’s program has been criticized by the public because ________.
    A) it causes damage to Net browsers  
    B) it can break into Internet sites  
    C) it can be used to cause disorder on all sites  
    D) it can be used by people with evil intent  

    正确答案： D
    34.
    	
    The author’s attitude toward SATAN is _____.
    A) ironical  
    B) neutral  
    C) positive  
    D) critical  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    The author suggests in the last paragraph that ________.
    A) we should make full use of the Internet before security measures are strengthened  
    B) we should alert the most influential businessmen to the importance of security  
    C) influential businessmen should give priority to the improvement of Net security  
    D) Net inhabitants should not let security measures affect their joy of surfing the Internet  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Too many vulnerable child-free adults are being ruthlessly (无情的) manipulated into parenthood by their parents, who think that happiness among older people depends on having a grandchild to spoil. We need an organization to help beat down the persistent campaigns of grandchildless parents. It’s time to establish Planned Grandparenthood, which would have many global and local benefits.
            Part of its mission would be to promote the risks and realities associated with being a grandparent. The staff would include depressed grandparents who would explain how grandkids break lamps, bite, scream and kick. Others would detail how an hour of baby-sitting often turns into a crying marathon. More grandparents would testify that they had to pay for their grandchild’s expensive college education.
            Planned Grandparenthood’s carefully written literature would detail all the joys of life grandchild-free: a calm living room, extra money for luxuries during the golden years, etc. Potential grandparents would be reminded that, without grandchildren around, it’s possible to have a conversation with your kids, who ― incidentally ― would have more time for their own parents. Meanwhile, most children are vulnerable to the enormous influence exerted by grandchildless parents aiming to persuade their kids to produce children. They will take a call from a persistent parent, even if they’re loaded with works. In addition, some parents make handsome money offers payable upon the grandchild’s birth. Sometimes these gifts not only cover expenses associated with the infant’s birth, but extras, too, like a vacation. In any case, cash gifts can weaken the resolve of even the noblest person.
            At Planned Grandparenthood, children targeted by their parents to reproduce could obtain non-biased information about the insanity of having their own kids. The catastrophic psychological and economic costs of childbearing would be emphasized.    
            The symptoms of morning sickness would be listed and horrors of childbirth pictured. A monthly newsletter would contain stories about overwhelmed parents and offer guidance on how childless adults can respond to the different lobbying tactics that would-be grandparents employ.
            When I think about all the problems of our overpopulated world and look at our boy grabbing at the lamp by the sofa, I wish I could have turned to Planned Grandparenthood when my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me.
            If I could have, I might not be in this parenthood predicament (窘境). But here’s the crazy irony, I don’t want my child-free life back. Dylan’s too much fun.

    36.
    	
    What’s the main purpose of the proposed organization Planned Grandparenthood?
    A) To provide effective tactics for the would-be grandparents.  
    B) To illustrate the happiness of grandchildless parents.  
    C) To provide facilities and services for grandchildless parents.  
    D) To discourage people from insisting on having grandchildren.  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    Which of the following measure is NOT included by Planned Grandparenthood in realizing its goal?
    A) Inviting the depressed grandparents to emphasize the difficulties grandchildren may cause.  
    B) Stressing the joy and happiness of a grandchild-free life.  
    C) Guiding the childless couples how to struggle with their persistent parents.  
    D) Advocating family planning to alleviate the problems caused by overpopulation in the world.  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    According to the passage, some couples may eventually choose to have children because ________.
    A) they find it hard to resist the carrot-and-stick approach of their parents  
    B) they have learnt from other parents about the joys of having children  
    C) they feel more and more lonely ad they grow older  
    D) they have found it irrational to remain childless  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    By saying "... I don’t want my child-free life back" (last paragraph), the author means that ________.
    A) I won’t pressure my son to have a child like my parents in the future  
    B) I miss my past life without a child  
    C) I enjoy my current life with a child  
    D) I wish my parents had never pressured me to have a child  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    What does the author think of the idea of having children?
    A) It does more harm than good.  
    B) It contributes to overpopulation.  
    C) It is troublesome but rewarding.  
    D) It is a psychological catastrophe.
