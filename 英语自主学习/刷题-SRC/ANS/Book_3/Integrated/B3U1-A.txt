    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 25 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            I’m not making anywhere near as much money as I did when I was employed full time, but now we don’t need as much either. I   21    enough income to handle our $600-a-month mortgage payments plus the usual expenses for a family like ours. That includes everything from music lessons and dental bills to car repairs and college costs. When it comes to insurance, we have a poor man’s major-medical policy. We have to pay the first $500 of any medical fees for each member of the family. It   22    80% of the costs beyond that. Although we are stuck with paying minor expenses, our premium is low ― only $560 a year ― and we are   23    against catastrophe.   24    that and the policy on our two cars at $400 a year, we have no other insurance. But we are setting aside $2,000 a year in an IRA.
            We’ve been able to make up the difference in income by   25    without appreciably lowering our standard of living. We continue to dine out once or twice a month, but now we patronize local restaurants   26    more expensive places in the city. We still attend the opera and ballet in Milwaukee but only a few times a year. We eat less meat, drink cheaper wine and see fewer movies.   27    Christmases are a memory, and we combine vacations with story assignments …
            I suspect not everyone who loves the country would be happy living the way we do. It takes a couple of special qualities. One is a   28    for solitude. Because we are so busy and on such a tight budget, we don’t entertain much. During the growing season there is no time for socializing anyway. Jim and Emily are   29    in school activities, but they too spend most of their time at home.
            The other requirement is energy ― a lot of it. The way to make self-sufficiency work on a small scale is to resist the   30    to buy a tractor and other expensive laborsaving devices. Instead, you do the work yourself. The only machinery we own (not counting the lawn mower) is a little three-horsepower rotary cultivator and a 16-inch chain saw.

    A) picks up	B) temptation	C) given	D) generate
    E) involved	F) instead of	G) Extravagant	H) cutting up

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Genetically modified foods (or GM foods) are foods derived from genetically modified organisms. Genetically modified organisms have had specific changes introduced into their DNA by genetic engineering techniques. GM foods were first put on the market in the early 1990s. Typically, genetically modified foods are transgenic plant products: soybean, corn, canola, and cotton seed oil. Animal products have also been developed, although as of July 2010 none are currently on the market.
            Critics have objected to GM foods on several grounds, including safety issues, ecological concerns, and economic concerns. However, genetically-modified foods are here to stay. That’s not to say that food produced by conventional agriculture will disappear, but simply that food-buying patterns will polarize (两极分化): there will be a right market for conventional food just as there is for organic food. It may even be that GM food will become the food of preference because consumers come to appreciate the health benefits of reduced pesticide use.
            The reason GM food will not go away is that we need a three-fold increase in food production by the year 2050 to keep pace with the world’s predicted population growth to ten or eleven billion. It’s not just a question of more mouths to feed either. What is often forgotten is that all these extra people will take up space, reducing the overall land available for agriculture.
            "Genetic modification is analogous to nuclear power: nobody loves it, but climate change has made its adoption imperative," says economist Paul Collier of Oxford University. "Declining genetic modification makes a complicated issue more complex. Genetic modification offers both faster crop adaptation and a biological, rather than chemical, approach to yield increases."
            The world has 800 million hungry people. Until now, food supplies have been increased by improved varieties, pesticides and artificial fertilizers: the green revolution. Now we’re on the edge of a new revolution: a genetic one.
            It may well be that in the long term it is the developing world that benefits most from GM foods. It’s true that for the next ten years or so GM crops may be too expensive. But the lesson of personal computers is applicable here ― once the technology has been developed for profitable crops, it will spread and become affordable for all. This doesn’t mean, unfortunately, that famines will disappear, but severity and duration will be helped by an improved ability to produce and distribute food.

    31.
    	
    The introduction of GM food will affect _____.
    A) food-pricing standard  
    B) food-buying patterns  
    C) food-supplies scale  
    D) food-production efficiency  

    正确答案： B
    32.
    	
    Consumers prefer GM food to conventional food because _____.
    A) GM food receives less pesticide application  
    B) GM food is more nutritious than organic food  
    C) GM food is cheaper than conventional food  
    D) Conventional food is free from chemicals  

    正确答案： A
    33.
    	
    If the world population grows to ten or eleven billion by the year 2050, _____.
    A) a genetic revolution will take over the green revolution  
    B) the overall land available for agriculture will run out  
    C) the number of hungry people will rise to 800 million  
    D) food production should be increased to three times that of today  

    正确答案： D
    34.
    	
    "But the lesson of personal computers is applicable here" (in the last paragraph) probably means that ______.
    A) once the technological innovation is in progress, its cost will be reduced  
    B) once the technology has been turned into productivity, it will become popular  
    C) once the technology has been developed for profitable products, it will enter into our daily life  
    D) once the technology has been improved to meet the demands of the developing world, it will be affordable  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    We can infer from the passage that GM food will _____
    A) be too expensive to afford  
    B) keep the world from starvation  
    C) be well-accepted by some consumers  
    D) eventually replace conventional food  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            The radical transformation of the Soviet society had a profound impact on women’s lives. Soviet women under Stalin were also the first generation of women able to give birth in the safety of a hospital, with access to prenatal care (产检). Marxists had traditionally believed that both capitalism and the middle-class husbands exploited women. The Russian Revolution of 1917 immediately proclaimed complete equality of rights for women. In the 1920s divorce and abortion were made easily available, and women were urged to work outside the home and liberate themselves sexually. After Stalin came to power, sexual and familial liberation was played down, and the most lasting changes for women involved work and education.
            These changes were truly revolutionary. Young women were constantly told that they had to be equal to men, that they could and should do everything men could do. Peasant women in Russia had long experienced the equality of backbreaking physical labor in the countryside, and they continued to enjoy that equality on collective farms. With the advent of the five-year-plans, millions of women also began to toil in factories and in heavy construction, building dams, roads and steel mills in summer heat and winter frost. Most of the opportunities open to men through education were also open to women. Determined women pursued their studies and entered the ranks of the better-paid specialists in industry and science. Medicine practically became a woman’s profession. By 1950, 75 percent of doctors in the Soviet Union were women.
            Thus Stalinist society gave women great opportunities but demanded great sacrifices as well. The vast majority of women simply had to work outside the home. Wages were so low that it was almost impossible for a family or couple to live only on the husband’s earnings. Moreover, the full-time working woman had a heavy burden of household tasks in her off hours, for most Soviet men in the 1930s still considered the home and the children the woman’s responsibility. Men continued to monopolize the best jobs. Finally, rapid change and economic hardship led to many broken families, creating further physical, emotional, and mental strains for women. In any event, the often-neglected human resource of women was mobilized in Stalinist society.

    36.
    	
    The main idea of this passage is that women in Stalinist society ________.
    A) had economic opportunities that had never been available before  
    B) had difficulty balancing their work and family responsibilities  
    C) had new opportunities but also many hardships  
    D) moved quickly into the highest levels of government  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    In the last paragraph, "monopolize" probably means _____.
    A) hold  
    B) earn  
    C) leave  
    D) pay  

    正确答案： A
    38.
