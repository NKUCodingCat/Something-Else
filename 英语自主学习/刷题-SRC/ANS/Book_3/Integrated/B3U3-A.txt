    Script:         Human rights groups say women suffer disproportionately from the global trade in small arms, considering that they are generally not the ones who buy and use guns. That’s according to a report issued ahead of International Women’s Day on Tuesday.
            The stories are uniformly horrifying, and they come from all over the world. A 19-year-old Iraqi woman is shot in the legs by her husband after she tried to escape their abusive relationship. A woman in the Solomon Islands is raped at gunpoint by a police commander. A schoolgirl in Brazil ends up in a wheelchair, after being caught in crossfire during an armed robbery.
            The report recommends that individual countries tighten gun-control laws, and demand licenses for anyone who wants to own a gun. It also recommends training police and other law enforcement officials to better understand and respect women’s situation when it comes to gun-related violence.

    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 25 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            Suburbs and country areas are, in many ways, even more   21    than well-patroled urban streets. Statistics show the crime rate rising more dramatically in those   22    tranquil areas than in cities.   23    , the era of leaving the front door on the latch is over.
            It has been   24    by dead-bolt locks, security chains, electronic alarm systems and trip wires hooked up to a police station or   25    guard firm. Many suburban families have sliding glass doors on their patios, with steel bars elegantly   26    so no one can pry the doors open.
            It is not uncommon, in the most pleasant of homes, to see   27    on the windows small notices   28    that the premises are under surveillance by this security force or that guard company.
            The lock is the new   29    of America. Indeed, a recent public-service advertisement by a large insurance company featured not charts showing how much at risk we are, but a picture of a child’s bicycle with the now-usual padlock   30    to it.

    A) private	B) built in	C) symbol	D) posted
    E) announcing	F) detached	G) pasted	H) attached
    I) personal	J) invulnerable	K) allegedly	L) vulnerable

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            In the villages of the English countryside there are still people who remember the good old days when no one bothered to lock their doors. There simply wasn’t any crime to worry about.
            Amazingly, these happy times appear still to be with us in the world’s biggest community. A new study by Dan Farmer, a gifted programmer, using an automated investigative program of his own called SATAN, shows that the owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up homes without fitting locks to their doors.
            SATAN can try out a variety of well-known hacking (黑客的) tricks on an Internet site without actually breaking in. Farmer has made the program publicly available, amid much criticism. A person with evil intent could use it to hunt down sites that are easy to burgle (闯入……行窃).
            But Farmer is very concerned about the need to alert the public to poor security and, so far, events have proved him right. SATAN has done more to alert people to the risks than cause new disorder.
            So is the Net becoming more secure? Far from it. In the early days, when you visited a Web site your browser simply looked at the content. Now the Web is full of tiny programs that automatically download when you look at a Web page, and run on your own machine. These programs could, if their authors wished, do all kinds of nasty things to your computer.
            At the same time, the Net is increasingly populated with spiders, worms, agents and other types of automated beasts designed to penetrate the sites and seek out and classify information. All these make wonderful tools for antisocial people who want to invade weak sites and cause damage.
            But let’s look on the bright side. Given the lack of locks, the Internet is surely the world’s biggest (almost) crime-free society. Maybe that is because hackers are fundamentally honest. Or that there currently isn’t much to steal. Or because vandalism (恶意破坏) isn’t much fun unless you have a peculiar dislike for someone.
            Whatever the reason, let’s enjoy it while we can. But expect it all to change, and security to become the number one issue, when the most influential inhabitants of the Net are selling services they want to be paid for.

    31.
    	
    By saying "... owners of well over half of all World Wide Web sites have set up home without fitting locks to their doors" (Para. 2), the author means that _____.
    A) those happy times appear still to be with us  
    B) the Internet is surely the world’s biggest crime-free society  
    C) many sites are not well-protected  
    D) the Internet is immune to hacking tricks  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    SATAN, a program designed by Dan Farmer can be used ____________.
    A) to investigate the security of Internet sites  
    B) to improve the security of the Internet system  
    C) to imitate hackers by pretending to break into websites  
    D) to provide the hacking program for the public  

    正确答案： A
    33.
    	
    Farmer’s program has been criticized by the public because ________.
    A) it causes damage to Net browsers  
    B) it can break into Internet sites  
    C) it can be used to cause disorder on all sites  
    D) it can be used by people with evil intent  

    正确答案： D
    34.
    	
    The author’s attitude toward SATAN is _____.
    A) ironical  
    B) neutral  
    C) positive  
    D) critical  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    The author suggests in the last paragraph that ________.
    A) we should make full use of the Internet before security measures are strengthened  
    B) we should alert the most influential businessmen to the importance of security  
    C) influential businessmen should give priority to the improvement of Net security  
    D) Net inhabitants should not let security measures affect their joy of surfing the Internet  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            It was the worst tragedy in maritime (航海的) history, six times more deadly than the Titanic. When the German cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by torpedoes (鱼雷) fired from a Russian submarine in the final winter of World War II, more than 10,000 people ― mostly women, children and old people fleeing the final Red Army push into Nazi Germany ― were packed aboard. An ice storm had turned the decks into frozen sheets that sent hundreds of families sliding into the sea as the ship tilted and began to go down. Others desperately tried to put lifeboats down. Some who succeeded fought off those in the water who had the strength to try to claw their way aboard. Most people froze immediately. I’ll never forget the screams," says Christa Ntitzmann, 87, one of the 1,200 survivors. She recalls watching the ship, brightly lit, slipping into its dark grave ― and into seeming nothingness, rarely mentioned for more than half a century.
            Now Germany’s Nobel Prize-winning author Gtinter Grass has revived the memory of the 9,000 dead, including more than 4,000 children ― with his latest novel Crab Walk, published last month. The book, which will be out in English next year, doesn’t dwell on the sinking; its heroine is a pregnant young woman who survives the catastrophe only to say later: "Nobody wanted to hear about it, not here in the West (of Germany) and not at all in the East." The reason was obvious.    
            As Grass put it in a recent interview with the weekly Die Woche: "Because the crimes we Germans are responsible for were and are so dominant, we didn’t have the energy left to tell of our own sufferings."
            The long silence about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was probably unavoidable ― and necessary. By unreservedly owning up to their country’s monstrous crimes in the Second World War, Germans have managed to win acceptance abroad, marginalize (使……不得势) the neo-Nazis at home and make peace with their neighbors. Today’s unified Germany is more prosperous and stable than at any time in its long, troubled history. For that, a half century of willful forgetting about painful memories like the German Titanic was perhaps a reasonable price to pay. But even the most politically correct Germans believe that they’ve now earned the right to discuss the full historical record. Not to equate German suffering with that of its victims, but simply to acknowledge a terrible tragedy.

    36.
    	
    Why does the author say the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was the worst tragedy in maritime history?
    A) It happened in the final winter of World War II.  
    B) It caused the largest number of casualties.  
    C) Most of its passengers were frozen to death.  
    D) Its victims were mostly women, children and old people.  

    正确答案： B
    37.

    A) the badly damaged ship leaned toward one side  
    B) the deck was frozen by an ice storm

    D) the frightened passengers fought desperately for lifeboats  

    正确答案： A
    38.
