            Nights are   21    in hospitals, but all through the night the young Marine sat there in the dimly-lit ward, holding the old man’s hand and   22    words of hope and strength.   23    , the nurse suggested that the Marine rest for a while. He refused.
            Whenever the nurse came into the ward, the Marine was there, but he   24    her and the night noises of the hospital ― the clanking of an oxygen tank, the laughter of night-staff members exchanging greetings, the cries and moans and snores of other   25    .

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            We see neighbors practically every day ― in the morning before we rush to work and in the evening when we return. But have you ever thought it over why neighbors are so important to our lives?
            Neighbors can help bring out our social best. After all, neighbors deserve to be treated with respect and friendliness like everyone else.
            Neighbors can be helpful too. They can help look after our houses when we are away on holiday. If you are new to the neighborhood, they can advise you on how things operate, where to go and so on.
            Hence, if you have a good relationship with your neighbors, it is easier to solve problems like who should keep the passageways clean, or who should do repairs on retaining walls (挡土墙) or fences.
            Of course, you have good and bad neighbors.
            The good neighbors help one another. A good neighbor may spend their own money buying young trees and planting them to beautify the neighborhood for everyone, or may help to dig a communal garden bed for roses.
            Good neighbors give each other food occasionally. It’s not what and how often you give, it’s the thought that counts.
            Then you have the bad neighbors.
            I know of a neighbor who trimmed the branches of his tree, letting them fall and damage another neighbor’s fence and nearby plants.
            Instead of seeking out the neighbor and paying for the damage, the stubborn neighbor kept quiet about the matter even when the victimized neighbor complained. The bad neighbor also had a fierce dog and does not bother to put it on a leash. This dog has frightened some older ladies living close by.
            Then there are neighbors who are a little bit too “nosy”. They invade your privacy too often by focusing on their binoculars on your homes or asking too many questions about your activities.
            If you have problems with your neighbors, you’d better discuss these with them openly. You might be living with them for years and it is in both your interests to solve these problems amicably (友善地).
            You can get a restraining order to stop a neighbor from harassing you or your property.
            Taking legal action to solve a problem with a neighbor should be the last choice. If you have to take this action, then it might be better to move to another neighborhood.

    31.

    A) Good Neighbors Make Life Easy  
    B) Neighbors: Helpers of Life

    D) How to Deal With Neighbors?

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            When you consciously keep thinking of something, your unconscious mind will somehow spontaneously push that idea or issue back to the surface even when you are doing something else, because your unconscious mind accepts, stores, and plays back everything that the conscious mind focuses on. The unconscious mind is like a “yes” person, agreeing, accepting and reminding.
            Hence, your unconscious mind can respond positively or negatively, depending on how you have consciously conditioned it ― by constantly thinking about something.
            If you keep thinking negatively of someone, you will constantly say negative things about that person when you are chatting away with another friend.
            If you keep telling yourself that it is very difficult to study English or that your English lecture is boring, then that thought will always crop up uninvited when you are chatting with someone or doing something else.
            That is how the unconscious mind works. That is why successful athletes who consciously, continuously and consistently focus on superior performance actually perform well because they are driven by their unconscious mind.
            It’s important to understand that whatever you consciously focus on, your unconscious mind will accept it. You need to think positively so that your unconscious mind will respond likewise.
            If you find yourself in a negative mood, discontinue that mood. Perhaps look at yourself through a mirror and see how “ugly” your face is when you are in a bitter mood. If you have a coin, flip it over. Say to yourself: “There are two sides of me, the good and the bad. Now I seem to be bad, so let’s focus on the good.”
            You must not hold a negative thought too long, or it will come back again and get more rooted in your system.
            Once you are in a negative system, it would take much more reprogramming to uproot the bad “trees” in your mind. You could have a full-grown negative “forest” in your mind ― and that could take ages to uproot. So place it with a positive thought. Affirm consciously, continuously and consistently your new positive image. Focus on the new trait visually and see yourself succeeding in it.
            Review your behavior. Do you moan and groan too often? Do you talk like a loser? Are you small-minded, selfish and unforgiving?
            It’s time you consciously conditioned your unconscious mind to work in a positive manner.

    36.
    	
    What is the best title for this passage?
    A) Train Your Unconscious Mind  
    B) Conscious Mind and Unconscious Mind  
    C) Uproot Negative Thoughts  
    D) How the Unconscious Mind Works  

    正确答案： A
    37.
    	
    How does the author support the idea that “one’s unconscious mind can respond positively or negatively”?
    A) By providing examples.  
    B) By giving reasons.  
    C) By stating people’s opinions.  
    D) By accounting his personal experiences.  

    正确答案： A
    38.

    D) how people condition their unconscious mind

    C) we are always better than what we think we are  
    D) our unconscious mind will accept whatever we consciously focus on  

    正确答案： D
    40.
