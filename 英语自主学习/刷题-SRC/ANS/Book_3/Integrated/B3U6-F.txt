    Script:         Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal relationships. The strength of the human condition is our tendency to give and receive support from one another under stressful circumstances. Social support consists of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. Those of us with strong support systems appear better able to cope with major life changes and daily hassles (困难). People with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. Studies over a range of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, reveal that the presence of social support helps people fend off (挡开) illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely.

            Nights are   21    in hospitals, but all through the night the young Marine sat there in the dimly-lit ward, holding the old man’s hand and   22    words of hope and strength.   23    , the nurse suggested that the Marine rest for a while. He refused.
            Whenever the nurse came into the ward, the Marine was there, but he   24    her and the night noises of the hospital ― the clanking of an oxygen tank, the laughter of night-staff members exchanging greetings, the cries and moans and snores of other   25    . Now and then she heard him say a few   26    words. The dying man said nothing, only held   27    to his son all through the night.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            When you consciously keep thinking of something, your unconscious mind will somehow spontaneously push that idea or issue back to the surface even when you are doing something else, because your unconscious mind accepts, stores, and plays back everything that the conscious mind focuses on. The unconscious mind is like a “yes” person, agreeing, accepting and reminding.
            Hence, your unconscious mind can respond positively or negatively, depending on how you have consciously conditioned it ― by constantly thinking about something.
            If you keep thinking negatively of someone, you will constantly say negative things about that person when you are chatting away with another friend.
            If you keep telling yourself that it is very difficult to study English or that your English lecture is boring, then that thought will always crop up uninvited when you are chatting with someone or doing something else.
            That is how the unconscious mind works. That is why successful athletes who consciously, continuously and consistently focus on superior performance actually perform well because they are driven by their unconscious mind.
            It’s important to understand that whatever you consciously focus on, your unconscious mind will accept it. You need to think positively so that your unconscious mind will respond likewise.
            If you find yourself in a negative mood, discontinue that mood. Perhaps look at yourself through a mirror and see how “ugly” your face is when you are in a bitter mood. If you have a coin, flip it over. Say to yourself: “There are two sides of me, the good and the bad. Now I seem to be bad, so let’s focus on the good.”
            You must not hold a negative thought too long, or it will come back again and get more rooted in your system.
            Once you are in a negative system, it would take much more reprogramming to uproot the bad “trees” in your mind. You could have a full-grown negative “forest” in your mind ― and that could take ages to uproot. So place it with a positive thought. Affirm consciously, continuously and consistently your new positive image. Focus on the new trait visually and see yourself succeeding in it.
            Review your behavior. Do you moan and groan too often? Do you talk like a loser? Are you small-minded, selfish and unforgiving?
            It’s time you consciously conditioned your unconscious mind to work in a positive manner.

    31.
    	
    What is the best title for this passage?
    A) Train Your Unconscious Mind  
    B) Conscious Mind and Unconscious Mind

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            I am an impatient man, so you may understand how I might respond to a roadblock. It happened in a mountain road to California. A young man stopped me at a barricade to tell me there would be a half-hour delay. In the next five minutes, I nervously put my hands on the file cases, records and so on. Cars were lining up behind me, and drivers began getting out of them. So did I. "It's a beautiful morning", an elderly man joined me at the roadside. I looked around strings of mist through the mountain tracing silver lines against the sky. There was a clean snap of autumn in the air.
            Later small groups of motorists had gathered along the roadside up the line. Someone took pictures. The delay became an event. It was that way during the last flood in my neighborhood, when the road was cut and power gone. People came out of their houses to talk. Others shared wine by lantern light and cooked over fireplaces.
            What does it take to get us talking? What does it take to bring us together, grabbing at the small alliances that form when the wind howls or when the traffic stops? We have so little time for one other.
            I heard a voice coming over the barricade attendant's walkie-talkie "OK" he said "the road's clear". I glanced at my watch, fifty-five minutes has passed. I couldn't believe I had remained still that long without going mad.
