    Section B 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.


            The rat race is often thought of as being (11)_________________ with the corporate environment where the company tries to (12)_________________ the most productivity out of its workers.
            With a (13)_________________ like that, it is no (14)_________________ that many people in our frenetic (忙乱的) modern life begin to question our (15)_________________ about work and begin seeking better (16)_________________ to escape the rat race. Can one make a living if one is to leave the rat race? How?
            One way is to become (17)_________________ and work for oneself ― such as a freelance (自由职业的) writer, web designer, consultant, etc. Another is to switch to a less demanding job, to a job where one is (18)_________________ , or to a job that requires less hours.
            Many tried and left the rat race. Some succeed and make more than before. Some end up making less, but happier. Some failed and have to return back to the rat race. Upon searching through the Internet and books, one will find many who have found ways to (19)_________________ without the rat race. However, this does not give an accurate percentage of those who succeeded versus (20)_________________ . It is typically those who made it that are the ones in the news and media.

    Script:         The rat race is often thought of as being associated with the corporate environment where the company tries to squeeze the most productivity out of its workers.
            With a definition like that, it is no wonder that many people in our frenetic (忙乱的) modern life begin to question our attitudes about work and begin seeking better alternatives to escape the rat race. Can one make a living if one is to leave the rat race? How?
            One way is to become self-employed and work for oneself ― such as a freelance (自由职业的) writer, web designer, consultant, etc. Another is to switch to a less demanding job, to a job where one is following one’s passion, or to a job that requires less hours.
            Many tried and left the rat race. Some succeed and make more than before. Some end up making less, but happier. Some failed and have to return back to the rat race. Upon searching through the Internet and books, one will find many who have found ways to make a living without the rat race.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            A new era is coming with a fundamental change in the way of work, in our industrialized world. Call it what you will: the service economy, the information age, the knowledge society. It all translates to a fundamental change in the way we work. Already we’re partly there. The percentage of people who earn their living by making things has fallen dramatically in the Western World. Today the majority of jobs in America, Europe and Japan (two thirds or more in many of these countries) are in the service industry, and the number is on the rise. More women are in the work force than ever before. There are more and more part-time jobs, and a growing number of people who are self-employed. But the breadth of the economic transformation can’t be measured by numbers alone, because it also is giving rise to a radical new way of thinking about the nature of work itself. Long-held notions about jobs and careers, the skills needed to succeed, even the relation between individuals and employers ― all these are being challenged.
            We have only to look behind us to get some sense of what may lie ahead. No one looking ahead 20 years possibly could have foreseen the ways in which a single invention, the chip (集成块), would transform our world thanks to its applications in personal computers, digital communications and factory robots. Tomorrow’s achievements in biotechnology, artificial intelligence or even some still unimagined technology could produce a similar wave of dramatic changes like the invention of the microchip. But one thing is certain: information and knowledge will become even more vital, and people who possess it, whether they work in manufacturing or services, will have the advantage and produce the wealth. Computer knowledge will become as basic a requirement as the ability to read and write.
            So the whole world will be computerized and some people will adapt, others won’t. But hopefully not all work will be equal. Some people argued, that people no longer should be classified as white or blue collar, manager or laborer, but rather as knowledge and service workers. The ability to solve problems by applying information instead of performing routine tasks will be valued above all else. But there will be a future in manufacturing, and the reason for that, is the move away from standardized production and toward more flexible, customized manufacturing. To survive, the workers have to think of new ways to meet the changing demands of customers.

    31.
    	
    A characteristic of the information age is that ________.
    A) the service industry is relying more and more on the female work force  
    B) manufacturing industries are steadily increasing  
    C) people find it harder and harder to earn a living by working in factories  
    D) most of the job opportunities can now be found in the service industry  

    正确答案： D
    32.
    	
    One of the great changes brought about by the knowledge society is that ________.
    A) the difference between the employee and the employer has become insignificant  
    B) people’s traditional concepts about work no longer hold true  
    C) most people have to take part-time jobs  
    D) people have to change their jobs from time to time  

    正确答案： B
    33.
    	
    By referring to computers and other inventions, the author means to say that ________.
    A) people should be able to respond quickly to the advancement of technology  
    B) future achievements in technology will bring about inconceivable dramatic changes  
    C) the importance of high technology has been overlooked  
    D) computer science will play a leading role in the future information services  

    正确答案： B
    34.

    A) possess and know how to make use of information  
    B) give full play to their brain potential  
    C) involve themselves in service industries  
    D) cast their minds ahead instead of looking back  

    正确答案： A
    35.
    	
    Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
    A) Computers and the Knowledge Society  
    B) Service Industries in Modern Society  
    C) Features and Implications of the New Era  
    D) Rapid Advancement of Information Technology  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            When global warming finally came, it stuck with a vengeance. In some regions, temperatures rose several degrees in less than a century. Sea levels shot up nearly 400 feet, flooding coastal settlements and forcing people to migrate inland. Deserts spread throughout the world as vegetation shifted drastically in North America, Europe and Asia. After driving many of the animals around them to near extinction, people were forced to abandon their old way of life for a radically new survival strategy that resulted in widespread starvation and disease. The adaptation was farming: the global-warming crisis that gave rise to it happened more than 10,000 years ago.
            As environmentalists convene in Rio de Janeiro this week to ponder the global climate of the future, earth scientists are in the midst of a revolution in understanding how climate has changed in the past ― and how those changes have transformed human existence. Researchers have begun to piece together an illuminating picture of the powerful geological and astronomical forces that have combined to change the planet’s environment from hot to cold, wet to dry and back again over a time period stretching back hundreds of millions of year.
            Most importantly, scientists are beginning to realize that the climatic changes have had a major impact on the evolution of the human species. New research now suggests that climate shifts have played a key role in nearly every significant turning point in human evolution: from the dawn of primates (灵长目动物) some 65 million years ago to human ancestors rising up to walk on two legs, from the huge expansion of the human brain to the rise of agriculture. Indeed, the human history has not been merely touched by global climate change, some scientists argue, it has in some instances been driven by it.
            The new research has profound implications for the environmental summit in Rio. Among other things, the findings demonstrate that dramatic climate change is nothing new for planet Earth. The benign (宜人的) global environment that has existed over the past 10,000 years ― during which agriculture, writing, cities and most other features of civilization appeared ― is a mere bright spot in a much larger pattern of widely varying climate over the ages. In fact, the pattern or climate change in the past reveals that Earth’s climate will almost certainly go through dramatic changes in the future ― even without the influence of human activity.

    36.
    	
    Farming emerged as a survival strategy because man had been obliged _______________.
    A) to give up his former way of life  
    B) to leave the coastal areas

    D) to abandon his original settlement

    A) is going through a fundamental change  
    B) has been getting warmer for 10,000 years  
    C) will eventually change from hot to cold  
    D) has gone through periodical changes  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    Scientists believe that human evolution _______________.
    A) has seldom been accompanied by climatic changes  
    B) has exerted little influence on climatic changes  
    C) has largely been affected by climatic changes  
    D) has had a major impact on climatic changes  

    正确答案： C
    39.

    A) human activities have accelerated changes of Earth’s environment  
    B) Earth’s environment will remain mild despite human interference  
    C) Earth’s climate is bound to change significantly in the future  
    D) Earth’s climate is unlikely to undergo substantial changes in the future  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    The message the author wishes to convey in the passage is that _______________.
    A) human civilization remains glorious though it is affected by climatic changes  
    B) mankind is virtually helpless in the face of the dramatic changes of climate  
    C) man has to limit his activities to slow down the global warming process  
    D) human civilization will continue to develop in spite of the changes of nature
