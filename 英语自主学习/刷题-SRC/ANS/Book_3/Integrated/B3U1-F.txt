    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage.

            In the past fifty years, American society has changed a great deal. Fifty years ago, most Americans lived in small communities. They   21    moved from one area to another and knew their neighbors at least by   22    if not by close, personal   23    . Life was so personal in those days that people often   24    about it. They said that a person could not even stay home from church on Sunday without the whole town knowing about it. It was difficult to have   25    in a small community like that, but there was usually a sense of security, of belonging, and of community togetherness in such places. Except for church and the local movie theater, there was not much in the way of entertainment. Some people dreamed about moving to the   26    life of the big cities, but most people were happy to live all their lives in the same community.
            Few people   27    this type of lifelong social interaction or sense of community togetherness now. People often move from neighborhood to neighborhood, city to city, and coast to coast. It is rare to find people who have lived all their lives in one community. Because people move so   28    , they do not have a chance to get to know their neighbors. Perhaps this is also why Americans tend to have a more casual   29    about friendships than people from some other cultures. Americans are   30    to leaving friends and making new friends.

    A) attitude	B) interaction	C) frequently	D) name
    E) joked	F) rarely	G) experience	H) exciting
    I) comparatively	J) correspondence	K) privacy	L) cheated
    M) accustomed	N) isolation	O) challenged

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            The radical transformation of the Soviet society had a profound impact on women’s lives. Soviet women under Stalin were also the first generation of women able to give birth in the safety of a hospital, with access to prenatal care (产检). Marxists had traditionally believed that both capitalism and the middle-class husbands exploited women. The Russian Revolution of 1917 immediately proclaimed complete equality of rights for women. In the 1920s divorce and abortion were made easily available, and women were urged to work outside the home and liberate themselves sexually. After Stalin came to power, sexual and familial liberation was played down, and the most lasting changes for women involved work and education.
            These changes were truly revolutionary. Young women were constantly told that they had to be equal to men, that they could and should do everything men could do. Peasant women in Russia had long experienced the equality of backbreaking physical labor in the countryside, and they continued to enjoy that equality on collective farms. With the advent of the five-year-plans, millions of women also began to toil in factories and in heavy construction, building dams, roads and steel mills in summer heat and winter frost. Most of the opportunities open to men through education were also open to women. Determined women pursued their studies and entered the ranks of the better-paid specialists in industry and science. Medicine practically became a woman’s profession. By 1950, 75 percent of doctors in the Soviet Union were women.
            Thus Stalinist society gave women great opportunities but demanded great sacrifices as well. The vast majority of women simply had to work outside the home. Wages were so low that it was almost impossible for a family or couple to live only on the husband’s earnings. Moreover, the full-time working woman had a heavy burden of household tasks in her off hours, for most Soviet men in the 1930s still considered the home and the children the woman’s responsibility. Men continued to monopolize the best jobs. Finally, rapid change and economic hardship led to many broken families, creating further physical, emotional, and mental strains for women. In any event, the often-neglected human resource of women was mobilized in Stalinist society.

    31.

    A) had economic opportunities that had never been available before  
    B) had difficulty balancing their work and family responsibilities

    D) moved quickly into the highest levels of government

    C) had not changed much  
    D) was better than that in capitalistic countries  
    
    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            A few years ago, Ann and Walter Taylor thought it might be time to move out of their New York City apartment to the suburbs. They had one young son and another child on the way. But after months of looking, they became discouraged and decided to buy an old townhouse right in the middle of Brooklyn, which is a part of New York City. To their delight, they discovered that they weren't the only young couple to have made such a decision. In fact, their entire area in Brooklyn had been settled by young families. And as a result, the neighborhood which had been declining for years was now being restored.
            In the 1940s, urban Americans began a mass move to the suburbs in search of fresh air, elbowroom, and privacy. Suburbs began to sprawl out across the countryside. Since most of the movers were middle-class, they took with them the tax money the cities needed to maintain the neighborhoods in which they had lived. The people left in the cities were often those who were too old or too poor to move. Thus, many cities began to fall into disrepair. Crime began to soar, and public transportation was neglected. Middle-class housing was allowed to decay, and little new housing was constructed.
            Eventually, many downtown areas existed for business only. During the day they would be filled with people working in offices, and at night they would be deserted. Given these circumstances, some business executives began asking, "Why bother with going downtown at all? Why not move the offices to the suburbs so that we can live and work in the same area?" Gradually, some of the larger companies began moving out of the cities, with the result that urban centers declined even further and the suburbs expanded still more. This movement of businesses to the suburbs is not confined to the United States. Businesses have also been moving to the suburbs in Stockholm, Sweden, in Bonn, Germany, and in Brussels, Belgium, as well.
            But it may well be that this movement to the suburbs has reached its peak. Some people may be tired of spending long hours commuting, and they may have began to miss the advantages of culture and companionship provided by city life. Perhaps the decision made by the Taylors is a sign that people will return to the cities and begin to restore them. It begins to look as if suburban sprawl may not have been the answer to man's need to create an ideal environment in which to live and work.
