    Section B 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

The tendency to regard creativity and imaginative thinking as the (15)_________________ province of a lucky few disregards the creative and imaginative aspects in the (16)_________________ of many of the tasks we regularly have to face ― the (17)_________________ and development of new methods and techniques, the improvement of old methods, existing inventions and products.

    Script:         When we think of creative people, the names that probably spring to mind are those of men such as Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, and Pablo Picasso, a select and exceptionally gifted body of men with rare talent and genius. The tendency to regard creativity and imaginative thinking as the exclusive province of a lucky few disregards the creative and imaginative aspects in the solution of many of the tasks we regularly have to face ― the discovery and development of new methods and techniques, the improvement of old methods, existing inventions and products. Everyone has creative ability to some extent. Creative talking involves posing oneself a problem and then originating or inventing a solution along new and unconventional lines. It involves drawing new analogies, discovering new combinations, and/or new applications of things that are already known. It follows, then, that a creative person will exhibit great intellectual curiosity and imagination. He will be alert and observant with a great store of information, which he will be able to sort out and combine in the solution of problems. He will be emotionally receptive to new and unconventional ideas and will be less interested in facts than in their implications.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            For about three centuries we have been doing science, trying science out, using science for the construction of what we call modern civilization. Every dispensable item of contemporary technology, from canal locks to dial telephones to penicillin, was pieced together from the analysis of data provided by one or another series of scientific experiments. Three hundred years seems a long time for testing a new approach to human inter-living, long enough to set back for critical appraisal of the scientific method, maybe even long enough to vote on whether to go on with it or not. There is an argument.
            Voices have been raised in protest since the beginning, rising in pitch and violence in the 19th century during the early stages of the industrial revolution, summoning urgent crowds into the streets on the issue of nuclear energy. "Give it back," say some of the voices, "It doesn't really work, we've tried it and it doesn't work. Go back three hundred years and start again on something else less chancy for the race of man."
            The principal discoveries in this century, taking all in all, are the glimpses of the depth of our ignorance of nature. Things that used to seem clear and rational, and matters of absolute certainty ― Newtonian mechanics, for example ― have slipped through our fingers; and we are left with a new set of gigantic puzzles, cosmic uncertainties, and ambiguities. Some of the laws of physics are amended every few years; some are canceled outright; some undergo revised versions of legislative intent as if they were acts of Congress.
            Just thirty years ago we call it a biological revolution when the fantastic geometry of the DNA molecule was exposed to public view and the linear language of genetics was decoded. For a while, things seemed simple and clear: the cell was a neat little machine, a mechanical device ready for taking to pieces and reassembling, like a tiny watch. But just in the last few years it has become almost unbelievably complex, filled with strange parts whose functions are beyond today’s imagining.
            It is not just that there is more to do, there is everything to do. What lies ahead, or what can lie ahead if the efforts in basic research are continued, is much more than the conquest of human disease or the improvement of agricultural technology or the cultivation of nutrients in the sea. As we learn more about fundamental processes of living things in general we will learn more about ourselves.

    31.
    	
    What CANNOT be inferred from the first paragraph?
    A) Scientific experiments in the past three hundred years have produced many valuable items.  
    B) For three hundred years there have been people holding a hostile attitude toward science.  
    C) Modern civilization depends on science so man supports scientific progress unanimously.  
    D) Some people think three hundred years is not long enough to set back for critical appraisal of scientific method.

    D) man has given up some of the once accepted theories

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Our culture has caused most Americans to assume not only that our language is universal but that the gestures we use are understood by everyone. We do not realize that waving good-bye is the way to summon a person to one's side in the Philippines, or that in Italy and some Latin-American countries, curling the finger to oneself is a sign of farewell.
            Those private citizens who sent packages to our troops occupying Germany after World War II and marked them GIFT to escape duty payments did not bother to find out that "Gift" means poison in German. Moreover, we like to think of ourselves as friendly, yet we prefer to be at least 3 feet or an arm's length away from others. Latins and Middle Easterners like to come closer and touch, which makes Americans uncomfortable.
            Our linguistic and cultural blindness and the casualness with which we take notice of the developed tastes, gestures, customs and language of other countries, are losing us friends, business and respect in the world.
            Even here in the United States, we make few concessions to the needs of foreign visitors. There are no information signs in four language on our public buildings or monuments; we do not have multilingual (多语的) guided tours. Very few restaurant menus have translations, and multilingual waiters, bank clerks and policemen are rare. Our transportation systems have maps in English only and often we ourselves have difficulty understanding them.
            When we go abroad, we tend to cluster in hotels and restaurants where English is spoken. The attitudes and information we pick up are conditioned by those natives ― usually the richer ― who speak English. Our business dealings, as well as the nation's diplomacy, are conducted through interpreters.
            For many years, America and Americans could get by with cultural blindness and linguistic ignorance. After all, America was the most powerful country of the world, the distributor of needed funds and goods.
            But all that is past. American dollars no longer buy all good things, and we are slowly beginning to realize that our proper role in the world is changing. A 1979 Harris poll reported that 55 percent of Americans want this country to play a more significant role in world affairs; we want to have a hand in the important decisions of the next century, even tough it may not always be the upper hand.

    36.
    	
    It can be inferred that Americans being approached too closely by Middle Easterners would most probably ________.
    A) stand still  
    B) jump aside  
    C) step forward  
    D) draw back  

    正确答案： D
    37.

    38.
    	
    In countries other than their own most Americans ________.
    A) are isolated by the local people  
    B) are not well informed due to the language barrier  
    C) tend to get along well with the natives  
    D) need interpreters in hotels and restaurants  

    正确答案： B
    39.

    A) affect their image in the new era  
    B) cut themselves off from the outside world  
    C) limit their role in world affairs  
    D) weaken the position of the US dollar

    C) it is necessary to use several languages in public places
