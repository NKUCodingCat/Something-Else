            It was 1943, during World War II, and I was a young U.S.   21    . My ship, the USS Murzim, had been   22    for several days. Most of her holds contained thousands of   23    of canned or dried foods. The other holds were loaded with five-hundred-pound bombs packed   24    in padded racks. Our   25    was a big base on the island of Tulagi in the South Pacific.
            I was one of the Murzim’s several   26    and, quite the same as for folk ashore, this Thanksgiving morning had seen us busily preparing a traditional dinner   27    roast turkey.
            Well, as any cook knows, it’s a lot of hard work to cook and serve a big meal, and clean up and put everything away. But finally, around   28    , we finished at last.
            I decided first to go out on the Murzim’s afterdeck for a breath of open air. I made my way out there,   29    in great, deep   30    while walking slowly about, still wearing my white cook’s hat.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Public distrust of scientists stems in part from the blurring of boundaries between science and technology, between discovery and manufacture. Most governments, perhaps all governments, justify public expenditure on scientific research in terms of the economic benefits the scientific enterprise has brought in the past and will bring in the future. Politicians remind their voters of the splendid machines “our scientists” have invented. At the same time, the politicians demand of scientists that they tailor their research to “economics needs”, that they award a higher priority to research proposals that are “near the market” and can be translated into the greatest return on investment in the shortest time. Dependent, as they are, on politicians for much of their funding, scientists have little choice but to comply. Like the rest of us, they are members of a society that rates the creation of wealth as the greatest possible good. Many have reservations, but keep them to themselves in what they perceive as a climate hostile to the pursuit of understanding for its own sake and the idea of an inquiring, creative spirit.
            In such circumstances no one should be too hard on people who are suspicious of conflicts of interest. When we learn that the distinguished professor assuring us of the safety of a particular product holds a consultancy with the company making it, we cannot be blamed for wondering whether his fee might conceivably cloud his professional judgment. Even if the professor holds no consultancy with any firm, some people many still distrust him because of his association with those who do, or at least wonder about the source of some of his research funding.
            This attitude can have damaging effects. It questions the integrity of individuals working in a profession that prizes intellectual honesty as the supreme virtue, and plays into the hands of those who would like to discredit scientists by representing them as venal (可以收买的). This makes it easier to dismiss all scientific pronouncements, but especially those made by the scientists who present themselves as “experts”. The scientist most likely to understand the safety of a nuclear reactor, for example, is a nuclear engineer who declares that a reactor is unsafe, and we believe him, because clearly it is not to his advantage to lie about it. If he tells us it is safe, on the other hand, we distrust him, because he may well be protecting the employer who pays his salary.

    31.
    	
    What is the chief concern of most governments when it comes to scientific research?
    A) The creativity of scientists.  
    B) The reduction of public expenditure.  
    C) Quick economic returns.  
    D) The budget for a research project.  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    Scientists have to tailor their research to “economic needs” in order to ________.
    A) win more awards  
    B) put theories into practice more efficiently  
    C) obtain funding from the government  
    D) pursue knowledge for knowledge’s sake  

    正确答案： C
    33.
    	
    Why won’t scientists complain about the government’s policy concerning scientific research?
    A) They think they work in an environment hostile to the free pursuit of knowledge.  
    B) They are accustomed to keeping their opinions to themselves.  
    C) They know it takes patience to win support from the public.  
    D) They think compliance with government policy is in the interests of the public.  

    正确答案： A
    34.
    	
    According to the author, people are suspicious of the professional judgment of scientists because ________.
    A) their pronouncements often turn out to be wrong  
    B) sometimes they hide the source of their research funding  
    C) some of them do not give priority to intellectual honesty  
    D) they could be influenced by their association with the project concerned  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    What damaging effects can public distrust of scientists have?
    A) Governments may spend less research funds on scientific research.  
    B) People may doubt the intellectual honesty and the statements of the so-called experts.  
    C) It may dampen the enthusiasm of scientists for independent research.  
    D) Scientists themselves may doubt the value of their research findings.  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Throughout the nation’s more than 15,000 school districts widely differing approaches to teaching science and math have emerged. Though there can be strength in diversity, a new international analysis suggests that this variability has instead contributed to lackluster (平淡的) achievement scores by U.S. children relative to their peers in other developed countries.
            Indeed, concludes William H. Schmidt of Michigan State University, who led the new analysis, “no single intellectually coherent vision dominates U.S. educational practice in math or science.” The reason, he said, “is because the system is deeply and fundamentally flawed.”
            The new analysis, released this week by the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va., is based on data collected from about 50 nations as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.
            Not only do approaches to teaching science and math vary among individual U.S. communities, the report finds, but there appears to be little strategic focus within a school district’s curricula, its textbooks, or its teachers’ activities. This contrasts sharply with the coordinated national programs of most other countries.
            On average, U.S. students study more topics within science and math than their international counterparts do. This creates an educational environment that “is a mile wide and an inch deep,” Schmidt notes.
            For instance, eighth graders in the United States cover about 33 topics in math versus just 19 in Japan. Among science courses, the international gap is even wider. U.S. curricula for this age level resemble those of a small group of countries including Australia, Thailand, Iceland, and Bulgaria. Schmidt asks whether the United States wants to be classed with these nations, whose educational systems “share our pattern of splintered (支离破碎的) visions” but which are not economic leaders.
            The new report “couldn’t come at a better time,” says Gerald Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association in Arlington. “The new National Science Education Standards provide that focused vision,” including the call “to do less, but in greater depth.”
            Implementing the new science standards and their math counterparts will be the challenge, he and Schmidt agree, because the decentralized responsibility for education in the United States requires that any reforms be tailored and instituted one community at a time.
            In fact, Schmidt argues, reforms such as these proposed national standards "face an almost impossible task, because even though they are intellectually coherent, each becomes only one more voice in the babble (嘈杂声)."

    36.
