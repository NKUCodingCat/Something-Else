    Section B 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Two other types of cloning produce complete, (12)_________________ identical animals. Blastomere separation (sometimes called " (13)_________________ " after the naturally occurring process that creates identical twins) involves splitting a developing embryo soon after (14)_________________ of the egg by a sperm (sexual reproduction) to give rise to two or more embryos. The resulting (15)_________________ are identical twins (clones) containing DNA from both the mother and the father. Dolly, on the other hand, is the result of another type of cloning that produces an animal carrying the DNA of only one parent. Using somatic cell (16)_________________ transfer, scientists transferred genetic material from the nucleus of an (17)_________________ sheep’s udder cell to an egg whose nucleus, and thus its genetic material, had been removed.

            I always thought that when our research was successful that I would just be pleased that we had   21    this when others had not. In reality, it is   22    ― when you look through the microscope, you see what you may have looked like a long time ago, at least in part.
            When I looked down and saw that cloned   23    , it brought tears to my eyes. I had done this for my mother, and I realized,   24    she only been able to live a few years longer, maybe we could have used this technology to help her. It was   25    to see that potential, which she never had a chance to experience.
            There’s a big   26    out there that we decided to destroy these embryos for some reason. There was so much   27    about this process because of the scientific   28    from the past that it was critical that there be no doubt that they were clones.
            In the process of analysis, the embryos were destroyed by   29    . In other words, to get the   30    material from inside the cells to analyze it, you have to destroy the cell.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            With only about 1,000 pandas left in the world, China is desperately trying to clone the animal and save the endangered species. That’s a move similar to what a Texas A&M University researcher has been undertaking for the past five years in a project called “Noah’s Ark.”
            Dr. Duane Kraemer, a professor in Texas A&M’s College of Veterinary Medicine and a pioneer in embryo transfer work and related procedures, says he salutes the Chinese effort and “I wish them all the best success possible. It’s a worthwhile project, certainly not an easy one, and it’s very much like what we're attempting here at Texas A&M ― to save animals from extinction.”
            Noah’s Ark is aimed at collecting eggs, embryos, semen and DNA of endangered animals and storing them in liquid nitrogen. If certain species should become extinct, Kraemer says there would be enough of the basic building blocks to reintroduce the species in the future.
            It is estimated that as many as 2,000 species of mammals, birds and reptiles will become extinct over the next 100 years. The panda, native only to China, is in danger of becoming extinct in the next 25 years.
            This week, Chinese scientists said they grew an embryo by introducing cells from a dead female panda into the egg cells of a Japanese white rabbit. They are now trying to implant the embryo into a host animal.
            The entire procedure could take from three to five years to complete.
            “The nuclear transfer of one species to another is not easy, and the lack of available panda eggs could be a major problem,” Kraemer believes. “They will probably have to do several hundred transfers to result in one pregnancy. It takes a long time and it’s difficult, but this could be groundbreaking science if it works. They are certainly not putting any live pandas at risk, so it is worth the effort,” adds Kraemer, who is one of the leaders of the Missyplicity Project at Texas A&M, the first ever attempt at cloning a dog.
            “They are trying to do something that’s never been done, and this is very similar to our work in Noah’s Ark. We’re both trying to save animals that face extinction. I certainly applaud their effort and there’s a lot we can learn from what they are attempting to do. It’s a research that is very much needed.”

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Depending on whom you ask, the experiment announced at a Texas medical conference last week was a potential breakthrough for infertile women, a tragic failure or a dangerous step closer to the nightmare scenario of human cloning.
            Infertility was clearly the motivation when Chinese doctors used a new technique to help one of their countrywomen get pregnant. Using a technique developed by Dr. James Grifo at New York University, Dr. Zhuang Guanglun of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou took the patient’s fertilized egg, scooped out the chromosome-bearing nuclear material and put it in a donated egg whose nucleus had been removed. In this more benign environment, development proceeded normally, and the woman became pregnant with triplets who carried a mix of her DNA and her husband’s ― pretty much like any normal baby.
            What has made some doctors and ethicists upset is that this so-called nuclear-transfer technique has also been used to produce clones, starting with Dolly the sheep. The only significant difference is that with cloning, the inserted nucleus comes from a single, usually adult, cell, and the resulting offspring is genetically identical to the parent. Doing that with humans is ethically repugnant to many. Besides, for reasons that aren’t yet well understood, cloned animals often abort spontaneously or are born with defects; Dolly died very young, though she had seemed healthy. And because the Chinese woman’s twins were born prematurely and died, critics have suggested that cloning and nuclear transfer are equally risky for humans.
            Not likely, says Grifo. “The obstetric outcome was a disaster,” he admits, “but the embryos were chromosomally normal. We have no evidence that it had anything to do with the procedure.” Even so, concern over potential risks is why the Food and Drug Administration created a stringent approval process for such research in 2001 ― a process that Grifo found so onerous that he stopped working on the technique and gave it to the researchers in China, where it was subsequently banned.
            The bottom line, say critics, is that perfecting a technique that could be used for human cloning, even if it were developed for another purpose, is just a bad idea ― an assertion Zhuang rejects. “I agree that it makes sense to control these experiments,” he says. “But we’ve developed an effective technology to help people. We understand how to do it. We need it.”

    36.
    	
    What is implied in the first paragraph?
    A) Some people regard it as a tragic failure.  
    B) The new experiment means a breakthrough for some people.  
    C) People have different reactions to the new experiment.  
    D) The new experiment means a step further to the dangerous human cloning.  

    正确答案： C
    37.
