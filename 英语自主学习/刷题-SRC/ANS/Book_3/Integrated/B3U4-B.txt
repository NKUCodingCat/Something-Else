    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            Although Einstein's five papers were published in a single year, he had been thinking about physics, deeply, since   21    . "Science was dinner-table conversation in the Einstein   22    ," explains Galison. Albert's father Hermann and uncle Jakob ran a German company making such things as dynamos, arc lamps,   23    and telephones. This was high-tech at the turn of the century, "like a Silicon Valley company would be today," notes Galison. "Albert's interest in science and technology came   24    ."
            Einstein's parents sometimes took Albert to parties. No babysitter was required: Albert sat on the couch, totally   25    , quietly doing math problems while others danced around him. Pencil and paper were Albert's GameBoy!
            He had   26    powers of concentration. Einstein's sister, Maja, recalled "... even when there was a lot of noise, he could   27    on the sofa, pick up a pen and paper,   28    balance an inkwell on the backrest and   29    himself in a problem so much that the background noise   30    rather than disturbed him."

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            There are designer shirts, skirts, and jeans, and now there's a designer sport: wallyball. Wallyball is a version of volleyball played on a racquetball court. It is hardly an old folk recreation that modern-day enthusiasts revived. Rather, Joe Garcia designed the sport when the racquetball boom peaked around 1980. The game is suitable for teams of two to four persons. The owners of racquetball clubs and neighboring pubs appreciate this quality ― instead of two people drinking beer after an hour on a racquetball court, wallyball provides up to eight.
            But let us backtrack a moment. In the beginning, there was handball. People played it in firehouses and gyms. The problem with handball is that it is played with a hard little rubber ball that stings the hands, and it requires that people use both hands equally well, which few people do. Then someone discovered that a hollow rubber ball and a short, strung racket could be used on handball game. While racquetball is easy to play poorly, the game is difficult to master and play well. When the masses took to jogging and aerobics, the owners of racquetball clubs found they could no longer make a living on racquetball alone. Enter Joe Garcia and wallyball.
            Wallyball seems a relatively trivial innovation. But its origins call our attention to the ever-changing, dynamic quality of life. We are led by a commonsense orientation to regard the world as stable. For practical purposes, most objects and events seem sufficiently durable to allow us to treat them as if they are unchanging. Indeed, we often think of permanence as being the natural state of affairs and change as something requiring special explanation. In reality, however, social life is an ongoing process, constantly renewing, remaking, and transforming itself. Events in the world compel people to change. As people change, they influence events in the social world of which they are a part. People like Joe Garcia, then, bring about change as they confront and deal with social life.

    A) as handball

    C) since it made no difference from racquetball  
    D) for it was more demanding than racquetball  

    正确答案： B
    33.

    A) when wallyball became popular  
    B) because it was not easy to play well for most people  
    C) because of the emergence of racquetball  
    D) because it cost too much

    B) People tend to view permanence as a common phenomenon.  
    C) Wallyball is a kind of innovation.  
    D) Social life is an unchanging process.  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Art is considered by many people to be little more than a decorative means of giving pleasure. This is not always the case, however; at times, art may be seen to have a purely functional side as well. Such could be said of the sand-paintings of the Navaho of the American Southwest; these have a medical as well as an artistic
    purpose.
            According to Navaho traditions, one who suffers from either a mental or a physical illness has in some way disturbed or come in contact with the supernatural (超自然的) ― perhaps a certain animal, a ghost, or the dead. To counteract this evil contact, the ill person or one of his relatives will employ a medicine man called a "singer" to perform a healing ceremony which will attract a powerful supernatural being. During the ceremony, which may last from 2 to 9 days，the "singer" will produce a sand painting on the floor of the Navaho house. On the last day of the ceremony, the patient will sit on this sand painting and the "singer" will rub the sick parts of the patient's body with sand. In this way the patient absorbs the power of that particular supernatural being and becomes strong like it. After the ceremony, the sand painting is then destroyed so its power will not harm anyone.
            The art of sand painting is handed down from old "singers" to their students. The materials used are easily found in the areas the Navaho inhabit: brown, red, yellow, and white sandstone, which is ground into powder by being crushed between 2 stones much as corn is ground into flour. The "singer" holds a small amount of this sand in his hand and lets it flow between his thumb and forefinger onto a clean, flat surface on the floor. With a steady hand and great patience, he is thus able to create designs of people, snakes and other creatures that have power in Navaho belief system.

    A) Functional.

    C) any animal  
    D) too many dead people  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    How can a sick person recover from his illness according to the passage?
    A) He must avoid the evil contact.  
    B) He needs help from another powerful supernatural being.  
    C) He must draw a sand painting.  
    D) He must sing at a ceremony.  

    正确答案： B
    39.

    A) not to allow others to use it freely  
    B) to harm the patient
