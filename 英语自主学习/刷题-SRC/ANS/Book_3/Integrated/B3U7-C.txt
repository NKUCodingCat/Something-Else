    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            When global warming finally came, it stuck with a vengeance. In some regions, temperatures rose several degrees in less than a century. Sea levels shot up nearly 400 feet, flooding coastal settlements and forcing people to migrate inland. Deserts spread throughout the world as vegetation shifted drastically in North America, Europe and Asia. After driving many of the animals around them to near extinction, people were forced to abandon their old way of life for a radically new survival strategy that resulted in widespread starvation and disease. The adaptation was farming: the global-warming crisis that gave rise to it happened more than 10,000 years ago.
            As environmentalists convene in Rio de Janeiro this week to ponder the global climate of the future, earth scientists are in the midst of a revolution in understanding how climate has changed in the past ― and how those changes have transformed human existence. Researchers have begun to piece together an illuminating picture of the powerful geological and astronomical forces that have combined to change the planet’s environment from hot to cold, wet to dry and back again over a time period stretching back hundreds of millions of year.
            Most importantly, scientists are beginning to realize that the climatic changes have had a major impact on the evolution of the human species. New research now suggests that climate shifts have played a key role in nearly every significant turning point in human evolution: from the dawn of primates (灵长目动物) some 65 million years ago to human ancestors rising up to walk on two legs, from the huge expansion of the human brain to the rise of agriculture. Indeed, the human history has not been merely touched by global climate change, some scientists argue, it has in some instances been driven by it.
            The new research has profound implications for the environmental summit in Rio. Among other things, the findings demonstrate that dramatic climate change is nothing new for planet Earth. The benign (宜人的) global environment that has existed over the past 10,000 years ― during which agriculture, writing, cities and most other features of civilization appeared ― is a mere bright spot in a much larger pattern of widely varying climate over the ages. In fact, the pattern or climate change in the past reveals that Earth’s climate will almost certainly go through dramatic changes in the future ― even without the influence of human activity.

    31.
    	
    Farming emerged as a survival strategy because man had been obliged _______________.
    A) to give up his former way of life  
    B) to leave the coastal areas  
    C) to follow the ever-shifting vegetation  
    D) to abandon his original settlement  

    正确答案： A
    32.
    	
    Earth scientists have come to understand that climate _______________.
    A) is going through a fundamental change  
    B) has been getting warmer for 10,000 years  
    C) will eventually change from hot to cold  
    D) has gone through periodical changes  

    正确答案： D
    33.
    	
    Scientists believe that human evolution _______________.
    A) has seldom been accompanied by climatic changes  
    B) has exerted little influence on climatic changes  
    C) has largely been affected by climatic changes  
    D) has had a major impact on climatic changes  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    Evidence of past climatic changes indicates that _______________.
    A) human activities have accelerated changes of Earth’s environment  
    B) Earth’s environment will remain mild despite human interference  
    C) Earth’s climate is bound to change significantly in the future  
    D) Earth’s climate is unlikely to undergo substantial changes in the future  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    The message the author wishes to convey in the passage is that _______________.
    A) human civilization remains glorious though it is affected by climatic changes  
    B) mankind is virtually helpless in the face of the dramatic changes of climate  
    C) man has to limit his activities to slow down the global warming process  
    D) human civilization will continue to develop in spite of the changes of nature  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Pop stars today enjoy a style of living which was once the prerogative only of Royalty. Wherever they go, people turn out in their thousands to greet them. The stars are transported in their chauffeur driven Rolls-Royces, private helicopters or executive airplanes. All their comings and goings are reported, for, like Royalty, pop stars are news. If they enjoy many of the privileges of Royalty, they certainly share many of the inconveniences as well. They must be constantly shielded from the adoring crowds which idolize them. They are no longer private individuals, but public property. The financial rewards they receive for this sacrifice cannot be calculated, for their rates of pay are astronomical.
            And why not? Society has always rewarded its top entertainers lavishly. The great days of Hollywood have become legendary: famous stars enjoyed fame, wealth and adulation on an unprecedented scale. By today’s standards, the excesses of Hollywood do not seem quite so spectacular. A single gramophone record nowadays may earn much more in royalties than the films of the past ever did. The competition for the title “Top of the Pops” is fierce, but the rewards are truly colossal.
            It is only right that the stars should be paid in this way. Don’t the top men in industry earn enormous salaries for the services they perform to their companies and their countries? Pop stars earn vast sums in foreign currency ― often more than large industrial concerns ― and the taxman can only be grateful for their massive annual contributions to the national treasury. So who would begrudge them their rewards?
            People who make envious remarks should remember that the most famous stars represent only the tip of the iceberg. For every famous star, there are hundreds of others struggling to earn a living. A man working in a steady job and looking forward to a pension at the end of it has no right to expect very high rewards. He has chosen security and peace of mind, so there will always be a limit to what he can earn. But a man who attempts to become a star is taking enormous risks. He knows at the beginning that only a handful of competitors ever get to the very top. He knows that years of concentrated effort may be rewarded with complete failure. But he knows, too, that the rewards for success are very high indeed: they are the recompense for the huge risks involved and if he achieves them, he has certainly earned them. That’s the essence of private enterprise.

    36.
    	
    The sentence “Pop stars today enjoy a style of living which was once the prerogative only of Royalty” means ____________.
    A) their life is as luxurious as that of royalty  
    B) they enjoy what once only belonged to the royalty  
    C) they are rather rich  
    D) their way of living is the same as that of the royalty  

    正确答案： B
    37.
    	
    What is the author’s attitude toward top stars’ high income?
    A) Approval.  
    B) Disapproval.  
    C) Ironical.  
    D) Critical.  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    What can be inferred from the last paragraph?
    A) There exists fierce competition in climbing to the top.  
    B) People are blind in idolizing stars.  
    C) Successful pop stars give great entertainment.  
    D) The tax the pop stars have paid is great.  

    正确答案： A
    39.

    A) successful men should get high-income repayment  
    B) pop stars make a great contribution to a country  
    C) pop stars can enjoy the life of royalty  
    D) successful men represent the tip of the iceberg  

    正确答案： D
    40.

    B) The second.  
    C) The third.  
    D) The fourth.
