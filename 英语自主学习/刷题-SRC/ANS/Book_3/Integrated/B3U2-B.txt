    Script:         The Little Rock Nine, as they later came to be called, were the first black teenagers to attend all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957. These remarkable young African-American students challenged segregation (隔离) in the deep South and won.
            Although Brown v. Board of Education outlawed segregation in schools, many school systems defied the law by intimidating and threatening black students ― Central High School was a notorious example. But the Little Rock Nine were determined to attend the school and receive the same education offered to white students. Things grew ugly and frightening right away. On the first day of school, the governor of Arkansas ordered the state’s National Guard to block the black students from entering the school. Imagine what it must have been like to be a student confronted by armed soldiers! President Eisenhower had to send in federal troops to protect the students.
            But that was only the beginning of their ordeal. Every morning on their way to school angry crowds of whites insulted the Little Rock Nine ― they even received death threats. One of the students, fifteen-year-old Elizabeth Eckford, said "I tried to see a friendly face somewhere in the mob … I looked into the face of an old woman, and it seemed a kind face, but when I looked at her again, she spat at me."

            A gentle   21    swept the Canadian plains as I stepped outside the small two-story house. Alongside me was a   22    woman in a black dress, my guide back to a time when the surrounding settlement in Dresden, Ontario, was home to a hero in American history.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            There was a time when big-league university presidents really mattered. The New York Times covered their every move. Presidents, the real ones, sought their counsel. For Woodrow Wilson and Dwight Eisenhower, being head of Princeton and Columbia, respectively, was a stepping-stone to the White House. Today, though, the job of college president is less and less removed from that of the Avon lady (except the house calls are made to the doorsteps of wealthy alums).
            Ruth Simmons, the newly installed president of Brown University and the first African American to lead an Ivy League school, is a throwback to the crusading campus leaders of old. She doesn’t merely marshal funds; she invests them in the great educational causes of our day. With the more than $300 million she raised as president of Smith College from 1995 to 2001, Simmons also established an engineering program (the first at any women’s school). At a meeting to discuss the future of Smith’s math department, one professor timidly requested two more discussion sections for his course. Her response: "Dream bigger."
            Her own dream was born in a sharecropper's shack in East Texas where there was no money for books or toys ― she and her 11 siblings each got an apple, an orange and 10 nuts for Christmas. When Simmons won a scholarship to Dillard University, her high school teachers took up a collection so she’d have a coat. She went on to Harvard to earn a Ph.D. in Romance languages.
            Simmons has made diversity her No. 1 campus crusade. She nearly doubled the enrollment of black freshmen at Smith, largely by traveling to high schools in the nation’s poorest ZIP codes to recruit. Concerned with the lives of minority students once they arrive at school, she has fought to ease the racial standoffs that plague so many campuses. In 1993, while vice provost at Princeton, she wrote a now famous report recommending that the university establish an office of conflict resolution to defuse racial misunderstandings before they boiled over.
            Her first task at Brown will be to heal one such rupture last spring after the student paper published an incendiary ad by conservative polemicist David Horowitz arguing that blacks economically benefited from slavery. "There’s no safe ground for anybody in race relations, but campuses, unlike any other institution in our society, provide the opportunity to cross racial lines," says Simmons. "And even if you’re hurt, you can’t walk away. You have to walk over that line."

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Probably the hardest part of setting goals is the first step of actually deciding to take action! The first barrier facing most people is the incorrect assumption that goals are only for business people. The reality is everyone sets goals mentally throughout the day. There are always occasions where something has to be done at a particular time or in a particular place. Simple examples could be getting up at a certain time in order to be at work, or to meet with a friend for a leisure activity.
            The beauty of having goals is the uniqueness of each one to the goal setter.
            Whether it is personal, financial, business or spiritual, they are all specific to that person and their circumstances.
            The most important part initially is to write them down. Having goals written down gives you incredible power while helping you to focus on this area.
            Aim for something that will stretch you while remaining achievable. If you achieve your goal too easily, it is not high enough to make any significant change in your life and needs to be adjusted. On the other hand, if you consistently miss the goals, you will only get discouraged and probably give up. The aim is to keep growing, and moving into a more satisfactory position for your particular circumstances.
            As you obtain the levels that you have set for yourself, always include a small reward at each point. This might only be a small thing in the early days like a meal out or a weekend vacation.
            Remember that these changes will not happen overnight and there will be a period of time when nothing seems to be happening. This is why the goals need to be detailed and as specific as possible with a consequence and benefit.
            Allow some time on a daily basis to educate yourself on how to make the necessary adjustments in your life. This could include listening to a CD, or reading a book on motivation, etc.
            A simple method to start with could be one goal in the main areas of life to be achieved in one month, six months, twelve months or five years. Break that down further into a daily, weekly and monthly system. Stay focused and disciplined to achieve all that you desire.

    36.
    	
    The simple examples in Paragraph 1 convey the message that ___________.
    A) goals are set mostly for important things  
    B) most people know when it is time to set goals  
    C) people set goals to get things done all the time  
    D) it is necessary to set goals occasionally
