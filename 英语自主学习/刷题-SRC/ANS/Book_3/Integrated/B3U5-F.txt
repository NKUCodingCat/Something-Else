    Script:         Thanksgiving in the United States is a day Americans have set aside to gather with loved ones, to feast, to be mindful of the gifts, both large and small, that they are grateful for, and to celebrate the value that gratitude itself brings to their lives.
            Like many Americans who have lost their jobs due to America’s ailing economy, Nancy has battled with mood swings in 2010. Still, she finds solace in keeping what she calls a “gratitude journal,” where she jots down all the little things she can be thankful for. “I was sitting in Nussbaum’s cafeteria up the street having coffee. And I love going there and just having coffee and I thought I was grateful for that place being there. Or for my kids. Or the fact that someone said something nice that day that I was glad to hear.” Nancy adds that everyday life is full of small gifts that can elude awareness. “But when you start to write, it starts to come out. It makes me realize that I have more in my life to be happy about than I thought I did.”
            For his part, Kyle, an art teacher, prefers to cultivate a thankful attitude for whatever life has in store. “I’m grateful for every day, man,” he says with a grin. “Every moment is new and exciting.

            Rather than saying they would forgive that I hadn’t   21    thanked them, instead, for Pete’s sake, they were thanking me ― for having remembered, for having considered they had done anything so   22    .
            Always the college professor, my dad had carefully avoided anything he considered too   23    , so I knew how moved he was to write me that, after having helped educate many young people, he now felt that his best results included his own son.
            The Reverend Nelson wrote that his   24    as a “simple, old-fashioned principal” had ended with schools undergoing such swift changes that he had retired in self-doubt. “I heard more of what I had done wrong than what I did right,” he said, adding that my letter had brought him welcome   25    that his career had been appreciated.
            A glance at Grandma’s   26    handwriting brought back in a flash memories of standing alongside her white rocking chair, watching her “settin’ down” some letter to relatives.   27    , Grandma would slowly   28    one word, then the next, so that a finished page would   29    hours.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Throughout the nation’s more than 15,000 school districts widely differing approaches to teaching science and math have emerged. Though there can be strength in diversity, a new international analysis suggests that this variability has instead contributed to lackluster (平淡的) achievement scores by U.S. children relative to their peers in other developed countries.
            Indeed, concludes William H. Schmidt of Michigan State University, who led the new analysis, “no single intellectually coherent vision dominates U.S. educational practice in math or science.” The reason, he said, “is because the system is deeply and fundamentally flawed.”
            The new analysis, released this week by the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va., is based on data collected from about 50 nations as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.
            Not only do approaches to teaching science and math vary among individual U.S. communities, the report finds, but there appears to be little strategic focus within a school district’s curricula, its textbooks, or its teachers’ activities. This contrasts sharply with the coordinated national programs of most other countries.
            On average, U.S. students study more topics within science and math than their international counterparts do. This creates an educational environment that “is a mile wide and an inch deep,” Schmidt notes.
            For instance, eighth graders in the United States cover about 33 topics in math versus just 19 in Japan. Among science courses, the international gap is even wider. U.S. curricula for this age level resemble those of a small group of countries including Australia, Thailand, Iceland, and Bulgaria. Schmidt asks whether the United States wants to be classed with these nations, whose educational systems “share our pattern of splintered (支离破碎的) visions” but which are not economic leaders.
            The new report “couldn’t come at a better time,” says Gerald Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association in Arlington. “The new National Science Education Standards provide that focused vision,” including the call “to do less, but in greater depth.”
            Implementing the new science standards and their math counterparts will be the challenge, he and Schmidt agree, because the decentralized responsibility for education in the United States requires that any reforms be tailored and instituted one community at a time.
            In fact, Schmidt argues, reforms such as these proposed national standards "face an almost impossible task, because even though they are intellectually coherent, each becomes only one more voice in the babble (嘈杂声)."

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            When I was growing up, I was embarrassed to be seen with my father. He was severely crippled and very short, and when we walked together, his hand on my arm for balance, people would stare. I would inwardly become uncomfortable at the unwanted attention. If he ever noticed or was bothered, he never revealed it.
            It was difficult to coordinate our steps ― his limping, mine impatient ― and because of that, we didn't say much as we went along. But as we started out, he always said, "You set the pace. I will try to adjust to you."
            Our usual walk was to or from the subway, which was how he got to work. He went to work sick, and despite nasty weather. He almost never missed a day, and would make it to the office even if others could not. A matter of pride.
            When snow or ice was on the ground, it was impossible for him to walk, even with help. At such times my sister and I would pull him through the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y., on a child's sleigh (雪橇) to the subway entrance. Once there he would cling to the handrail until he reached the lower steps that the warmer tunnel air kept ice-free. In Manhattan the subway station was the basement of his office building, and he would not have to go outside again until we met him in Brooklyn on his way home.
            When I think of it now, I marvel at how much courage it must have taken for a grown man to subject himself to such indignity and stress, and at how he did it ― without bitterness or complaint.
            He never talked about himself as an object of pity, nor did he show any envy of the more fortunate or able. What he looked for in others was a "good heart", and if he found one, the owner was good enough for him.
            Unable to engage in many activities, my father still tried to participate in some way. When the local sandlot baseball team found itself without a manager, he kept it going. He was a knowledgeable baseball fan and often took me to Ebbets Field to see the Brooklyn Dodgers play. He liked to go to dances and parties, where he could have a good time just sitting and watching.
            He had been gone many years now, but I think of him often. I wonder if he sensed my reluctance to be seen with him during our walks. If he did, I am sorry I never told him how sorry I was, how unworthy I was, how I regretted it. I think of him when I complain about trifles, when I am envious of another's good fortune, and when I don't have a "good heart".
            At such times I put my hand on his arm to regain my balance, and say, "You set the pace. I will try to adjust to you."
