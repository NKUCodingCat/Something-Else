            Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them. He was past sixty and had a long white beard curling down over his chest. Despite looking the part, Behrman was a   21    in art. For forty years he had been always about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it. He earned a little by   22    as a model to those young artists who could not pay the price of a   23    . He drank gin to excess, and still talked of his coming masterpiece.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            When you consciously keep thinking of something, your unconscious mind will somehow spontaneously push that idea or issue back to the surface even when you are doing something else, because your unconscious mind accepts, stores, and plays back everything that the conscious mind focuses on. The unconscious mind is like a “yes” person, agreeing, accepting and reminding.
            Hence, your unconscious mind can respond positively or negatively, depending on how you have consciously conditioned it ― by constantly thinking about something.
            If you keep thinking negatively of someone, you will constantly say negative things about that person when you are chatting away with another friend.
            If you keep telling yourself that it is very difficult to study English or that your English lecture is boring, then that thought will always crop up uninvited when you are chatting with someone or doing something else.
            That is how the unconscious mind works. That is why successful athletes who consciously, continuously and consistently focus on superior performance actually perform well because they are driven by their unconscious mind.
            It’s important to understand that whatever you consciously focus on, your unconscious mind will accept it. You need to think positively so that your unconscious mind will respond likewise.
            If you find yourself in a negative mood, discontinue that mood. Perhaps look at yourself through a mirror and see how “ugly” your face is when you are in a bitter mood. If you have a coin, flip it over. Say to yourself: “There are two sides of me, the good and the bad. Now I seem to be bad, so let’s focus on the good.”
            You must not hold a negative thought too long, or it will come back again and get more rooted in your system.
            Once you are in a negative system, it would take much more reprogramming to uproot the bad “trees” in your mind. You could have a full-grown negative “forest” in your mind ― and that could take ages to uproot. So place it with a positive thought. Affirm consciously, continuously and consistently your new positive image. Focus on the new trait visually and see yourself succeeding in it.
            Review your behavior. Do you moan and groan too often? Do you talk like a loser? Are you small-minded, selfish and unforgiving?
            It’s time you consciously conditioned your unconscious mind to work in a positive manner.

    31.
    	
    What is the best title for this passage?
    A) Train Your Unconscious Mind  
    B) Conscious Mind and Unconscious Mind  
    C) Uproot Negative Thoughts  
    D) How the Unconscious Mind Works  

    正确答案： A

    A) By providing examples.  
    B) By giving reasons.  
    C) By stating people’s opinions.

    D) how people condition their unconscious mind

    34.

    B) our unconscious mind should agree with our true potential  
    C) we are always better than what we think we are  
    D) our unconscious mind will accept whatever we consciously focus on  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    What can we infer from the sentence “You could have a full-grown negative ‘forest’ in your mind ― and that could take ages to uproot” (Para. 9)?

    B) It takes consistent effort to get rid of negative thoughts.  
    C) Negative thoughts are a part of learning in our lives.  
    D) There are always many negative thoughts in our minds.  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            I was sitting in back of a little girl, put on the plane by mother who placed a Care Bear in her arms and told her to remind Daddy to call when she got to California. The girl adjusted her seat belt and sniffed back a tear, bravely setting her jaw.
            As we prepared for takeoff, the man next to the girl asked her the name of her bear and nodded in approval, saying Furry was a good name for a bear. When the little girl told him she was 6 years old, the man replied that he had a daughter who was 6 years old. His daughter was missing the same teeth, in fact.
            By the time we were in the air, the man and the little girl were playing tic-tac-toe, and she revealed to him the names of her favorite friends. Somewhere over Ohio, I fell asleep, awakened by my mother instinct when I heard a child announce that she had to go to the bathroom.
            “It’s in the back, right?” I heard the girl say to the man. The flight attendants were busy collecting lunch trays.
            “Do you want me to take you there?” the man asked, standing.
            At once my antennae were up and, leaning into the aisle, I craned my neck, practically knocking heads with the woman in the seat across from me. For one moment our eyes locked. She had been listening, too, and both of us had the same idea. Would this man go into the bathroom with the child? I held my breath as he held open the bathroom door.
            Then the man showed the girl how the lock worked and waited outside the door. The woman and I sighed in relief. She said, “Well, you can’t be too careful these days.”
            I’ve thought about that man on the plane since then, and the image of him and the girl always leaves an empty sorrow. I know that sexual abuse of children is awful, which we must guard against. But it saddened me that I looked at someone who understood a child’s fear and saw a child molester.
            These are trying times for men. We women say how we want men to be sensitive and nurturing, to be caring and affectionate. But my sense is that now these qualities cannot be readily displayed without arousing suspicion. Perhaps there is some sort of ironic punishment for all those years of accepting the male stereotypes. But there is a real loss here for us all when we must always be wary of the kindness of strangers.

    36.
    	
    What is the central theme of this passage?
    A) These are trying times for men because all the attention on sexual abuse of children has made even their kindness appear to be evil.  
    B) The author felt sorry for the little girl who had to fly by herself, but meanwhile, she admired the child’s bravery.  
    C) Child molesters can find victims even in airplanes, so all travelers should be suspicious of anyone who is kind to children flying alone.  
    D) Because of her increased awareness that some people are child molesters, the author realizes she has become suspicious of people who are kind to strangers’ children.  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    Why did the man say Furry was a good name?
    A) He had once had a bear named Furry.  
    B) He wanted to make the little girl settle down so that she would not bother him.  
    C) He wanted to make her feel comfortable and secure.  
    D) The bear was very fluffy, and so Furry seemed an appropriate name.  

    正确答案： C
    38.
    	
    Why did the little girl’s announcement that she had to go to the bathroom wake up the author?
    A) The child was speaking very loudly and moving around in her seat.  
    B) The author was afraid the child might have an accident unless someone took her to the bathroom right away.  
    C) As a mother, the author thought she should be the one asked to take the little girl to the bathroom.  
    D) As a mother, the author was used to listening, even in her sleep, for children’s calls for help.  

    正确答案： D
    39.
    	
    By saying “Well, you can’t be too careful these days” (Para. 7) the woman was communicating that she was ______.
    A) annoyed at the flight attendants for being too busy to take the little girl to the bathroom  
    B) angry that the little girl had asked the man instead of the nearby woman for help.  
    C) slightly embarrassed that she had worried about what the man might do to the little girl  
    D) somewhat worried that the girl was too little to learn how to use the bathroom lock  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    What does the author mean when she says “there is a real loss here for us all when we must always be wary of the kindness of strangers” (Para.9)?
    A) Constant suspicion is a poisonous feeling, preventing people from watching a man being kind to a child.  
    B) Because rarely is there a way of telling who might be evil, people stop talking to strangers and miss chances to make friends.  
    C) Years ago, fewer child molesters existed, so parents had peace of mind that now has been lost.  
    D) Because people today are constantly on the lookout for child molesters, nice people like the author are afraid to be kind to strangers’ children.
