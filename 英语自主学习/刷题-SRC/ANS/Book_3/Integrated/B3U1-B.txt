    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            There are two things I have always wanted to do ― write and live on a farm. Today I’m doing both. I am not in E. B. White’s class as a writer or in my neighbors’ league as a farmer, but I’m getting by. And after years of   21    with city and suburban living, my wife Sandy and I have finally found   22    here in the country.
            It’s a   23    sort of life. We grow nearly all of our fruits and vegetables. Our hens keep us in eggs, with several dozen left over to sell each week. Our bees provide us with honey, and we cut enough wood to just about   24    it _____ the heating season.
            It’s a   25    life too. In the summer we canoe on the river, go picnicking in the woods and take long bicycle rides. In the winter we ski and   26    . We get excited about sunsets. We love the   27    of the earth warming and the sound of cattle lowing. We watch for hawks in the sky and deer in the cornfields.
            But the good life can get pretty tough. Three months ago when it was 30 below, we spent two   28    days hauling firewood up the river on a sled. Three months from now, it will be 95 above and we will be   29    corn, weeding strawberries and killing chickens. Recently, Sandy and I had to retile the back roof. Soon Jim, 16 and Emily, 13, the youngest of our four children, will help me make some long-overdue improvements on the outdoor toilet that   30    our indoor plumbing when we are working outside. Later this month, we’ll spray the orchard, paint the barn, plant the garden and clean the hen house before the new chicks arrive.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            A few years ago, Ann and Walter Taylor thought it might be time to move out of their New York City apartment to the suburbs. But after months of looking, they became discouraged and decided to buy an old house right in the middle of Brooklyn, which is a part of New York City. To their delight, they discovered that they weren’t the only young couple to have made such a decision.
            Brooklyn isn’t the only city in the United States to experience this kind of renewal. Charleston, South Carolina, has so successfully rebuilt its old central area that it now ranks as one of America’s most charming cities. The restoration of the old port city of Savannah, Georgia, is also living proof that downtown areas do not need to die. But encouraging as these developments may be, they are among the few bright spots in a mass of difficulties that today’s cities face.
            In the 1940s, urban Americans began a mass move to the suburbs in search of fresh air, elbowroom, and privacy. Suburbs began to sprawl out across the countryside. Since most of those making the move were middle-class, they took with them the tax money the cities needed to maintain the neighborhoods in which they had lived. Thus, many cities began to fall into disrepair. Crime began to soar, and public transportation was neglected. Meanwhile, housing construction costs continued to rise higher and higher. Middle-class housing was allowed to decay, and little new housing was constructed.
            Eventually, many downtown areas existed for business only. During the day, they would be filled with people working in offices, and at night they would be deserted. Given these circumstances, some business executives began asking, "Why bother with going downtown at all? Why not move the offices to the suburbs so that we can live and work in the same area?" Gradually, some of the larger companies began moving out of the cities, with the result that urban centers declined even further and the suburbs expanded still more. This movement of business to the suburbs is not confined to the United States. Business has also been moving to the suburbs in major European countries.
            But it may well be that this movement to the suburbs has reached its peak. Some people may be tired of spending long hours commuting, and they may have begun to miss the advantages of culture and companionship provided by city life. Perhaps, the decision made by the Taylors is a sign that people will return to the cities and begin to restore them. It begins to look as if suburban sprawl may not have been the answer to man’s need to create an ideal environment in which to live and work.

    31.
    	
    The author of the passage suggests that _____.
    A) moving to the suburbs is not the answer to an ideal environment  
    B) cities are likely to be replaced by suburbs  
    C) downtown areas are too crowded to live in  
    D) American people move a lot in history

    D) only old and poor people were left in the cities  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            The estimates of the numbers of home-schooled children vary widely. The U.S. Department of Education estimates there are 250,000 to 350,000 home-schooled children in the country. Home school advocates put the number much higher ― at about a million.
            Public schools take a harsh attitude toward home schoolers, perceiving their actions as the ultimate slap in the face for public education and a damaging move for the children. Home schoolers harbor few kind words for public schools, charging shortcomings that range from lack of religious perspective in the curriculum to a herdlike approach to teaching children.
            Yet, as public school officials realize they stand little to gain by remaining hostile to the home school population, and as home schoolers realize they can reap benefits from public schools, these hard lines seem to be softening a bit.
            Public schools and home schoolers have moved closer to tolerance and, in some cases even cooperation. Says John Marshall, an education official, "we are becoming relatively tolerant of home schoolers. The idea is, let’s give the kids access to public school so they’ll see it’s not as terrible as they’ve been told, and they’ll want to come back." Perhaps, but don’t count on it, say home school advocates.
            Home schoolers oppose the system because they have strong convictions that their approach to education ― whether fueled by religious enthusiasm or the individual child’s interest and natural pace ― is the best. "The bulk of home schoolers just want to be left alone." says Enge Cannon, associate director of the National Center for Home Education. She says home schoolers choose that path for a variety of reasons, but religion plays a role 85 percent of the time.
            Professor Van Galen breaks home schoolers into two groups. Some home schoolers want their children to learn not only traditional subject matter but also "strict religious doctrine (教条) and a conservative political and social perspective. Not incidentally, they also want their children to learn ― both intellectually and emotionally ― that the family is the most important institution in society." Other home schoolers contend "not so much that the schools teach heresy (异端邪说), but that schools teach whatever they teach inappropriately." Van Galen writes. "These parents are highly independent and strive to take responsibility for their own lives within a society that they define as bureaucratic (官僚主义) and inefficient."

    36.
    	
    Which of the following statements is true?
    A) Home schoolers engage private teachers to provide additional education for their children.  
    B) Home schoolers don’t go to school but are educated at home by their parents.  
    C) Home schoolers educate their children at home instead of sending them to school.  
    D) Home schoolers advocate combining public education with home schooling.  

    正确答案： C
    37.
    	
    Public schools are softening their position on home schooling because ________.
    A) they want to show their tolerance for different teaching systems  
    B) there isn’t much they can do to change the present situation  
    C) they have so many problems that they cannot offer proper education for all children  
    D) home schooling provides a new variety of education for children  

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    Most home schoolers’ opposition to public education stems from their _______.
    A) concern with the cost involved  
    B) worry about the inefficiency of public schools  
    C) devotion to religion  
    D) respect for the interests of individuals  

    正确答案： C
    39.
    	
    From the passage we know that home school advocates think that ________.
    A) home schooling is superior and therefore they will not easily give in  
    B) their increased cooperation with public schools will bring about the improvement of public education  
    C) public schooling is not so bad as has often been said  
    D) their tolerance of public education will attract more kids to public schools  

    正确答案： A
    40.
    	
    It can be concluded from Van Galen’s research that some home schoolers believe that ________.
    A) teachers in public schools are not as responsible as they should be  
    B) public schools take up a herdlike approach to teaching children  
    C) public schools are the source of bureaucracy and inefficiency in modern society  
    D) public schools cannot provide education that is good enough for their children
