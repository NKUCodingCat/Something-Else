    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 25 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            In the past fifty years, American society has changed a great deal. Fifty years ago, most Americans lived in small communities. They   21    moved from one area to another and knew their neighbors at least by   22    if not by close, personal   23    . Life was so personal in those days that people often   24    about it. They said that a person could not even stay home from church on Sunday without the whole town knowing about it. It was difficult to have   25    in a small community like that, but there was usually a sense of security, of belonging, and of community togetherness in such places. Except for church and the local movie theater, there was not much in the way of entertainment. Some people dreamed about moving to the   26    life of the big cities, but most people were happy to live all their lives in the same community.
            Few people   27    this type of lifelong social interaction or sense of community togetherness now. People often move from neighborhood to neighborhood, city to city, and coast to coast. It is rare to find people who have lived all their lives in one community. Because people move so   28    , they do not have a chance to get to know their neighbors. Perhaps this is also why Americans tend to have a more casual   29    about friendships than people from some other cultures. Americans are   30    to leaving friends and making new friends.

    A) attitude	B) interaction	C) frequently	D) name
    E) joked	F) rarely	G) experience	H) exciting
    I) comparatively	J) correspondence	K) privacy	L) cheated
    M) accustomed	N) isolation	O) challenged

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            It is well that young men should begin at the beginning and occupy the most subordinate positions. Many of the leading businessmen of Pittsburgh had a serious responsibility thrust upon them at the very threshold of their career. They were introduced to the broom, and spent the first hours of their business lives sweeping out the office. I notice we have janitors and janitresses now in offices, and our men unfortunately miss that beneficial branch of business education. But if by chance the professional sweeper is absent any morning, the boy who has the genius of the future partner in him will not hesitate to try his hand at the broom. It dose not hurt the newest comer to sweep out the office if necessary. I was one of those sweepers myself.
            Assuming that you have all obtained employment and are fairly started, my advice to you is "aim high." Say to yourself, "My place is at the top." Be king in your dreams. And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret: concentrate your energy, thought, and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged. The concerns which fail are those which have scattered their capital, which means that they have scattered their brains also. "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" is all wrong. I tell you "put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket." Look around you and take notice; men who do that do not often fail. It is easy to watch and carry the one basket. It is trying to carry too many baskets that break most eggs in the country. He who carries three baskets must put one on his head, which is apt to tremble and trip (摔倒) him up.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Despite a cooling of the economy, high-technology companies are still crying out for skilled workers. The Information Technology Association of America projects that more than 800,000 technology jobs will go unfilled next year. The lack of qualified workers poses a huge threat to the U.S. economy.
            The most commonly cited reason for this state of affairs is that the country's agrarian-age (农村时代) education system fails to prepare students in the primary and secondary grades for twenty-first-century work. Yet an inadequate and outmoded education system is only part of the problem. A less tangible but equally powerful cause is an antique classification system that divides the workforce into two camps: white-collar knowledge workers and blue-collar manual laborers.
            Blue-collar workers emerged in the United States during the Industrial Age as work migrated from farms to factories. White-collar office workers became a significant class in the twentieth century, outnumbering the blue-collar workers by mid-century. Corporations increasingly require a new layer of knowledge worker: a highly skilled multi-disciplined talent, who combines the mind of the white-collar worker with a solid grounding in mathematics and science (physics, chemistry, and biology). These "gold-collar" workers ― so named for their contributions to their companies and to the economy as well as for their personal earning ability ― apply that knowledge to technology.
            The gold-collar worker already exists in a wide range of jobs. The maintenance technician who tests and repairs aircraft systems at American Airlines; the network administrator who manages systems and network operations at Procter & Gamble; the engineering technologist who assists scientists at Sandia National Laboratories; and the advanced-manufacturing technician at Intel can all be regarded as gold-collar workers.

    D) learnt more in high school
