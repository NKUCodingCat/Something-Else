    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Our culture has caused most Americans to assume not only that our language is universal but that the gestures we use are understood by everyone. We do not realize that waving good-bye is the way to summon a person to one's side in the Philippines, or that in Italy and some Latin-American countries, curling the finger to oneself is a sign of farewell.
            Those private citizens who sent packages to our troops occupying Germany after World War II and marked them GIFT to escape duty payments did not bother to find out that "Gift" means poison in German. Moreover, we like to think of ourselves as friendly, yet we prefer to be at least 3 feet or an arm's length away from others. Latins and Middle Easterners like to come closer and touch, which makes Americans uncomfortable.
            Our linguistic and cultural blindness and the casualness with which we take notice of the developed tastes, gestures, customs and language of other countries, are losing us friends, business and respect in the world.
            Even here in the United States, we make few concessions to the needs of foreign visitors. There are no information signs in four language on our public buildings or monuments; we do not have multilingual (多语的) guided tours. Very few restaurant menus have translations, and multilingual waiters, bank clerks and policemen are rare. Our transportation systems have maps in English only and often we ourselves have difficulty understanding them.
            When we go abroad, we tend to cluster in hotels and restaurants where English is spoken. The attitudes and information we pick up are conditioned by those natives ― usually the richer ― who speak English. Our business dealings, as well as the nation's diplomacy, are conducted through interpreters.
            For many years, America and Americans could get by with cultural blindness and linguistic ignorance. After all, America was the most powerful country of the world, the distributor of needed funds and goods.
            But all that is past. American dollars no longer buy all good things, and we are slowly beginning to realize that our proper role in the world is changing. A 1979 Harris poll reported that 55 percent of Americans want this country to play a more significant role in world affairs; we want to have a hand in the important decisions of the next century, even tough it may not always be the upper hand.

    31.
    	
    It can be inferred that Americans being approached too closely by Middle Easterners would most probably ________.
    A) stand still  
    B) jump aside  
    C) step forward  
    D) draw back  

    正确答案： D
    32.

    B) casual manners  
    C) indifference towards foreign visitors  
    D) arrogance towards other cultures  

    正确答案： A
    33.
    	
    In countries other than their own most Americans ________.
    A) are isolated by the local people  
    B) are not well informed due to the language barrier  
    C) tend to get along well with the natives  
    D) need interpreters in hotels and restaurants  

    正确答案： B
    34.
    	
    According to the author, American's cultural blindness and linguistic ignorance will _______.
    A) affect their image in the new era  
    B) cut themselves off from the outside world  
    C) limit their role in world affairs  
    D) weaken the position of the US dollar  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    The author's intention in writing this article is to make Americans realize that _______.
    A) it is dangerous to ignore their foreign friends  
    B) it is important to maintain their leading role in world affairs  
    C) it is necessary to use several languages in public places  
    D) it is time to get acquainted with other cultures  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            There are designer shirts, skirts, and jeans, and now there's a designer sport: wallyball. Wallyball is a version of volleyball played on a racquetball court. It is hardly an old folk recreation that modern-day enthusiasts revived. Rather, Joe Garcia designed the sport when the racquetball boom peaked around 1980. The game is suitable for teams of two to four persons. The owners of racquetball clubs and neighboring pubs appreciate this quality ― instead of two people drinking beer after an hour on a racquetball court, wallyball provides up to eight.
            But let us backtrack a moment. In the beginning, there was handball. People played it in firehouses and gyms. The problem with handball is that it is played with a hard little rubber ball that stings the hands, and it requires that people use both hands equally well, which few people do. Then someone discovered that a hollow rubber ball and a short, strung racket could be used on handball game. While racquetball is easy to play poorly, the game is difficult to master and play well. When the masses took to jogging and aerobics, the owners of racquetball clubs found they could no longer make a living on racquetball alone. Enter Joe Garcia and wallyball.
            Wallyball seems a relatively trivial innovation. But its origins call our attention to the ever-changing, dynamic quality of life. We are led by a commonsense orientation to regard the world as stable. For practical purposes, most objects and events seem sufficiently durable to allow us to treat them as if they are unchanging. Indeed, we often think of permanence as being the natural state of affairs and change as something requiring special explanation. In reality, however, social life is an ongoing process, constantly renewing, remaking, and transforming itself. Events in the world compel people to change. As people change, they influence events in the social world of which they are a part. People like Joe Garcia, then, bring about change as they confront and deal with social life.



    36.
    	
    Wallyball first appeared _______.
    A) as handball  
    B) as racquetball  
    C) in ancient time  
    D) in about 1980  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    The owners of racquetball clubs and neighboring pubs welcomed wallyball _______.
    A) because it was more interesting than racquetball  
    B) as more people are involved in the game  
    C) since it made no difference from racquetball  
    D) for it was more demanding than racquetball  

    正确答案： B
    38.
    	
    Handball went out of fashion _______.
    A) when wallyball became popular  
    B) because it was not easy to play well for most people  
    C) because of the emergence of racquetball  
    D) because it cost too much  

    正确答案： B
    39.
    	
    The origins of wallyball can be traced back to _______.
    A) handball  
    B) racquetball  
    C) ancient time  
    D) 1980  

    正确答案： A
    40.

    A) People are a part of the social world.  
    B) People tend to view permanence as a common phenomenon.  
    C) Wallyball is a kind of innovation.  
    D) Social life is an unchanging process.
