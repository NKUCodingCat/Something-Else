    Script:         Psychologists take opposing views on how external rewards, from warm praise to cold cash, affect motivation and creativity. Behaviorists, who study the relation between actions and their consequences, argue that rewards can improve performance at work and school. Cognitive researchers, who study various aspects of mental life, maintain that rewards often destroy creativity by encouraging dependence on approval and gifts from others. The latter view has gained many supporters especially among educators. But the careful use of small monetary rewards sparks creativity in grade school children, suggesting that properly presented inducements indeed aid inventiveness, according to a study in the June Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. "If kids know they're working for a reward and can focus on a relatively challenging task, they show the most creativity," says Robert Eisenberger of the University of Delaware in Newark. But it's easy to kill creativity by giving rewards for poor performance or creating too much anticipation for rewards.

    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 25 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            Although Einstein's five papers were published in a single year, he had been thinking about physics, deeply, since   21    . "Science was dinner-table conversation in the Einstein   22    ," explains Galison. Albert's father Hermann and uncle Jakob ran a German company making such things as dynamos, arc lamps,   23    and telephones. This was high-tech at the turn of the century, "like a Silicon Valley company would be today," notes Galison. "Albert's interest in science and technology came   24    ."
            Einstein's parents sometimes took Albert to parties. No babysitter was required: Albert sat on the couch, totally   25    , quietly doing math problems while others danced around him. Pencil and paper were Albert's GameBoy!
            He had   26    powers of concentration. Einstein's sister, Maja, recalled "... even when there was a lot of noise, he could   27    on the sofa, pick up a pen and paper,   28    balance an inkwell on the backrest and   29    himself in a problem so much that the background noise   30    rather than disturbed him."

    A) engross	B) mess	C) household	D) revolutionize
    E) outbreak	F) naturally	G) beholden	H) undermine
    I) impressive	J) lie down	K) light bulbs	L) precariously

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            For about three centuries we have been doing science, trying science out, using science for the construction of what we call modern civilization. Every dispensable item of contemporary technology, from canal locks to dial telephones to penicillin, was pieced together from the analysis of data provided by one or another series of scientific experiments. Three hundred years seems a long time for testing a new approach to human inter-living, long enough to set back for critical appraisal of the scientific method, maybe even long enough to vote on whether to go on with it or not. There is an argument.
            Voices have been raised in protest since the beginning, rising in pitch and violence in the 19th century during the early stages of the industrial revolution, summoning urgent crowds into the streets on the issue of nuclear energy. "Give it back," say some of the voices, "It doesn't really work, we've tried it and it doesn't work. Go back three hundred years and start again on something else less chancy for the race of man."
            The principal discoveries in this century, taking all in all, are the glimpses of the depth of our ignorance of nature. Things that used to seem clear and rational, and matters of absolute certainty ― Newtonian mechanics, for example ― have slipped through our fingers; and we are left with a new set of gigantic puzzles, cosmic uncertainties, and ambiguities. Some of the laws of physics are amended every few years; some are canceled outright; some undergo revised versions of legislative intent as if they were acts of Congress.
            Just thirty years ago we call it a biological revolution when the fantastic geometry of the DNA molecule was exposed to public view and the linear language of genetics was decoded. For a while, things seemed simple and clear: the cell was a neat little machine, a mechanical device ready for taking to pieces and reassembling, like a tiny watch. But just in the last few years it has become almost unbelievably complex, filled with strange parts whose functions are beyond today’s imagining.
            It is not just that there is more to do, there is everything to do. What lies ahead, or what can lie ahead if the efforts in basic research are continued, is much more than the conquest of human disease or the improvement of agricultural technology or the cultivation of nutrients in the sea. As we learn more about fundamental processes of living things in general we will learn more about ourselves.

    31.

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Art is considered by many people to be little more than a decorative means of giving pleasure. This is not always the case, however; at times, art may be seen to have a purely functional side as well. Such could be said of the sand-paintings of the Navaho of the American Southwest; these have a medical as well as an artistic
    purpose.
            According to Navaho traditions, one who suffers from either a mental or a physical illness has in some way disturbed or come in contact with the supernatural (超自然的) ― perhaps a certain animal, a ghost, or the dead. To counteract this evil contact, the ill person or one of his relatives will employ a medicine man called a "singer" to perform a healing ceremony which will attract a powerful supernatural being. During the ceremony, which may last from 2 to 9 days，the "singer" will produce a sand painting on the floor of the Navaho house. On the last day of the ceremony, the patient will sit on this sand painting and the "singer" will rub the sick parts of the patient's body with sand. In this way the patient absorbs the power of that particular supernatural being and becomes strong like it. After the ceremony, the sand painting is then destroyed so its power will not harm anyone.
            The art of sand painting is handed down from old "singers" to their students. The materials used are easily found in the areas the Navaho inhabit: brown, red, yellow, and white sandstone, which is ground into powder by being crushed between 2 stones much as corn is ground into flour. The "singer" holds a small amount of this sand in his hand and lets it flow between his thumb and forefinger onto a clean, flat surface on the floor. With a steady hand and great patience, he is thus able to create designs of people, snakes and other creatures that have power in Navaho belief system.
