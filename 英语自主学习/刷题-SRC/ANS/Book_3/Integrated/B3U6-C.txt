    Script:         Since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal relationships. The strength of the human condition is our tendency to give and receive support from one another under stressful circumstances. Social support consists of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. Those of us with strong support systems appear better able to cope with major life changes and daily hassles (困难). People with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. Studies over a range of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, reveal that the presence of social support helps people fend off (挡开) illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely.

            Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them. He was past sixty and had a long white beard curling down over his chest. Despite looking the part, Behrman was a   21    in art. For forty years he had been always about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it. He earned a little by   22    as a model to those young artists who could not pay the price of a   23    . He drank gin to excess, and still talked of his coming masterpiece.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            When you consciously keep thinking of something, your unconscious mind will somehow spontaneously push that idea or issue back to the surface even when you are doing something else, because your unconscious mind accepts, stores, and plays back everything that the conscious mind focuses on. The unconscious mind is like a “yes” person, agreeing, accepting and reminding.
            Hence, your unconscious mind can respond positively or negatively, depending on how you have consciously conditioned it ― by constantly thinking about something.
            If you keep thinking negatively of someone, you will constantly say negative things about that person when you are chatting away with another friend.
            If you keep telling yourself that it is very difficult to study English or that your English lecture is boring, then that thought will always crop up uninvited when you are chatting with someone or doing something else.
            That is how the unconscious mind works. That is why successful athletes who consciously, continuously and consistently focus on superior performance actually perform well because they are driven by their unconscious mind.
            It’s important to understand that whatever you consciously focus on, your unconscious mind will accept it. You need to think positively so that your unconscious mind will respond likewise.
            If you find yourself in a negative mood, discontinue that mood. Perhaps look at yourself through a mirror and see how “ugly” your face is when you are in a bitter mood. If you have a coin, flip it over. Say to yourself: “There are two sides of me, the good and the bad. Now I seem to be bad, so let’s focus on the good.”
            You must not hold a negative thought too long, or it will come back again and get more rooted in your system.
            Once you are in a negative system, it would take much more reprogramming to uproot the bad “trees” in your mind. You could have a full-grown negative “forest” in your mind ― and that could take ages to uproot. So place it with a positive thought. Affirm consciously, continuously and consistently your new positive image. Focus on the new trait visually and see yourself succeeding in it.
            Review your behavior. Do you moan and groan too often? Do you talk like a loser? Are you small-minded, selfish and unforgiving?
            It’s time you consciously conditioned your unconscious mind to work in a positive manner.

    31.
    	
    What is the best title for this passage?
    A) Train Your Unconscious Mind  
    B) Conscious Mind and Unconscious Mind  
    C) Uproot Negative Thoughts  
    D) How the Unconscious Mind Works  

    正确答案： A
    32.
    	
    How does the author support the idea that “one’s unconscious mind can respond positively or negatively”?
    A) By providing examples.  
    B) By giving reasons.  
    C) By stating people’s opinions.  
    D) By accounting his personal experiences.

    A) how good performance affects one’s unconscious mind  
    B) how a positive unconscious mind develops  
    C) how a person’s unconscious mind works positively  
    D) how people condition their unconscious mind  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    When conditioning your unconscious mind, it is very important to understand that _______.
    A) we should avoid aiming too high  
    B) our unconscious mind should agree with our true potential  
    C) we are always better than what we think we are  
    D) our unconscious mind will accept whatever we consciously focus on  

    正确答案： D
    35.
    	
    What can we infer from the sentence “You could have a full-grown negative ‘forest’ in your mind ― and that could take ages to uproot” (Para. 9)?
    A) Negative thoughts are potential obstacles to our further development.  
    B) It takes consistent effort to get rid of negative thoughts.  
    C) Negative thoughts are a part of learning in our lives.  
    D) There are always many negative thoughts in our minds.  

    正确答案： B

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            It is the last day of the school year and I stand empty-handed with no gift to give you.
            It isn’t that I haven’t tried to think of something meaningful and special … quite to the contrary. For months, I have combed catalogs, browsed speciality shops and department stores, and even searched the Internet only to realize that nothing could measure up to the feelings of a mother’s grateful heart and a teacher’s loving dedication.
            How I wish a colorful bundle of fresh wildflowers could reflect the beauty of your way with children ― the constant patience and nurturing, the gentle encouragement. Jewelry would surely be nice, but what can I afford that would not soon tarnish and grow quickly out of style? You deserve the gems of royalty for your determination and creativity, your devotion and talent. During the past year, I have given you many small gifts, mostly intangible ones.
            At the moment the first school bell rang last August, I placed in you my trust, believing you would teach my child and reserve respect for me as a parent. I added to that my constant and devoted prayers that you would be objective and fair to set limitations while offering my child a chance to learn self-control and to soar a bit in the process. I sincerely petitioned that your classroom would be a safe shelter for my child to grow and learn, which is a perfect mixture of self-discipline and controlled instruction. I prayed for your health and your happiness, and your ability to be supplied with the tools necessary to complete your task as teacher and educator. I offered you my time as often as I could, and my support for your cause. Occasionally, I even offered you a challenge when I spoke my mind, sometimes standing firm, sometimes giving up with a renewed assurance or a “wait and see” attitude!
            I wish with all my heart I could put a delicate ribbon on a wrapped package and give you a “something” to express my appreciation and affection, but I have nothing to give you that would surpass the most precious gift I have ever had to offer and which you already so pleasantly accepted months ago ― the one you have held close to your heart, laughed with and probably cried with, applauded and scolded, encouraged and molded ― my child!
            And today, as my child returns to my side for the summer, the gift I humbly give to you is found deep within my heart …
            I give to you my thanks.
