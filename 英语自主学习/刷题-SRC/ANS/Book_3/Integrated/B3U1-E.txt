Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            There are two things I have always wanted to do ― write and live on a farm. Today I’m doing both. I am not in E. B. White’s class as a writer or in my neighbors’ league as a farmer, but I’m getting by. And after years of   21    with city and suburban living, my wife Sandy and I have finally found   22    here in the country.
            It’s a   23    sort of life. We grow nearly all of our fruits and vegetables. Our hens keep us in eggs, with several dozen left over to sell each week. Our bees provide us with honey, and we cut enough wood to just about   24    it _____ the heating season.
            It’s a   25    life too. In the summer we canoe on the river, go picnicking in the woods and take long bicycle rides. In the winter we ski and   26    . We get excited about sunsets. We love the   27    of the earth warming and the sound of cattle lowing. We watch for hawks in the sky and deer in the cornfields.
            But the good life can get pretty tough. Three months ago when it was 30 below, we spent two   28    days hauling firewood up the river on a sled. Three months from now, it will be 95 above and we will be   29    corn, weeding strawberries and killing chickens. Recently, Sandy and I had to retile the back roof. Soon Jim, 16 and Emily, 13, the youngest of our four children, will help me make some long-overdue improvements on the outdoor toilet that   30    our indoor plumbing when we are working outside. Later this month, we’ll spray the orchard, paint the barn, plant the garden and clean the hen house before the new chicks arrive.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.

            It is well that young men should begin at the beginning and occupy the most subordinate positions. Many of the leading businessmen of Pittsburgh had a serious responsibility thrust upon them at the very threshold of their career. They were introduced to the broom, and spent the first hours of their business lives sweeping out the office. I notice we have janitors and janitresses now in offices, and our men unfortunately miss that beneficial branch of business education. But if by chance the professional sweeper is absent any morning, the boy who has the genius of the future partner in him will not hesitate to try his hand at the broom. It dose not hurt the newest comer to sweep out the office if necessary. I was one of those sweepers myself.
            Assuming that you have all obtained employment and are fairly started, my advice to you is "aim high." Say to yourself, "My place is at the top." Be king in your dreams. And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret: concentrate your energy, thought, and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged. The concerns which fail are those which have scattered their capital, which means that they have scattered their brains also. "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" is all wrong. I tell you "put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket." Look around you and take notice; men who do that do not often fail. It is easy to watch and carry the one basket. It is trying to carry too many baskets that break most eggs in the country. He who carries three baskets must put one on his head, which is apt to tremble and trip (摔倒) him up.



    31.

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Despite a cooling of the economy, high-technology companies are still crying out for skilled workers. The Information Technology Association of America projects that more than 800,000 technology jobs will go unfilled next year. The lack of qualified workers poses a huge threat to the U.S. economy.
            The most commonly cited reason for this state of affairs is that the country's agrarian-age (农村时代) education system fails to prepare students in the primary and secondary grades for twenty-first-century work. Yet an inadequate and outmoded education system is only part of the problem. A less tangible but equally powerful cause is an antique classification system that divides the workforce into two camps: white-collar knowledge workers and blue-collar manual laborers.
            Blue-collar workers emerged in the United States during the Industrial Age as work migrated from farms to factories. White-collar office workers became a significant class in the twentieth century, outnumbering the blue-collar workers by mid-century. Corporations increasingly require a new layer of knowledge worker: a highly skilled multi-disciplined talent, who combines the mind of the white-collar worker with a solid grounding in mathematics and science (physics, chemistry, and biology). These "gold-collar" workers ― so named for their contributions to their companies and to the economy as well as for their personal earning ability ― apply that knowledge to technology.
            The gold-collar worker already exists in a wide range of jobs. The maintenance technician who tests and repairs aircraft systems at American Airlines; the network administrator who manages systems and network operations at Procter & Gamble; the engineering technologist who assists scientists at Sandia National Laboratories; and the advanced-manufacturing technician at Intel can all be regarded as gold-collar workers.
