    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            It was the worst tragedy in maritime (航海的) history, six times more deadly than the Titanic. When the German cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by torpedoes (鱼雷) fired from a Russian submarine in the final winter of World War II, more than 10,000 people ― mostly women, children and old people fleeing the final Red Army push into Nazi Germany ― were packed aboard. An ice storm had turned the decks into frozen sheets that sent hundreds of families sliding into the sea as the ship tilted and began to go down. Others desperately tried to put lifeboats down. Some who succeeded fought off those in the water who had the strength to try to claw their way aboard. Most people froze immediately. I’ll never forget the screams," says Christa Ntitzmann, 87, one of the 1,200 survivors. She recalls watching the ship, brightly lit, slipping into its dark grave ― and into seeming nothingness, rarely mentioned for more than half a century.
            Now Germany’s Nobel Prize-winning author Gtinter Grass has revived the memory of the 9,000 dead, including more than 4,000 children ― with his latest novel Crab Walk, published last month. The book, which will be out in English next year, doesn’t dwell on the sinking; its heroine is a pregnant young woman who survives the catastrophe only to say later: "Nobody wanted to hear about it, not here in the West (of Germany) and not at all in the East." The reason was obvious.    
            As Grass put it in a recent interview with the weekly Die Woche: "Because the crimes we Germans are responsible for were and are so dominant, we didn’t have the energy left to tell of our own sufferings."
            The long silence about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was probably unavoidable ― and necessary. By unreservedly owning up to their country’s monstrous crimes in the Second World War, Germans have managed to win acceptance abroad, marginalize (使……不得势) the neo-Nazis at home and make peace with their neighbors. Today’s unified Germany is more prosperous and stable than at any time in its long, troubled history. For that, a half century of willful forgetting about painful memories like the German Titanic was perhaps a reasonable price to pay. But even the most politically correct Germans believe that they’ve now earned the right to discuss the full historical record. Not to equate German suffering with that of its victims, but simply to acknowledge a terrible tragedy.

    31.

    B) they hope to be accepted by other countries  
    C) they only want to make the tragedy clear  
    D) they just show sympathy to the dead  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            The government’s new cyber-security officials yesterday asked telecommunications companies for help in building a government computer network that would have no risk of outside penetration ― a task some computer security consultants say is nearly impossible. Plans for the private network, called Govnet, hinge on whether a reliable network infrastructure can be built at an affordable price, officials said. Computer system consultants said they could not estimate how much the network would cost because of the government’s enormous size and security needs. Richard Clarke, who was appointed special adviser to the president for cyberspace security this week, said he believes a more reliable system can be built. Ninety percent of available fiber-optic space is unused and fairly inexpensive to obtain, he said.
            Govnet is part of a plan Clarke announced earlier this week to secure our cyberspace from a range of possible threats, from hackers to criminals to terrorist groups, to foreign nations, which might use cyber-war against us in the future. Govnet would be completely independent from the Internet to help keep out hackers and viruses, according to the government’s plan. The request from the General Services Administration asks that telecommunications companies submit proposals about how the network could be built, how much it would cost, and how long it would take to construct.
            This year, the current network has been breached by hackers, computer worms and viruses. The system was also roughed up by the Code Red computer worm and an attack program called I Love You. The viruses affected thousands of government computers. Last year a report by the General Accounting Office, an internal government watchdog, found weaknesses in the computer network that could allow terrorists or hackers to severely damage or disrupt national defense or vital public operations or steal sensitive data. Clarke said the government's current virtual private network is vulnerable to viruses and denial-of-service attacks that would make it more difficult to execute Govnet.
            An internal network, such as the Govnet proposal, is worth investigating but will probably fall to sophisticated hackers, said Amit Yoran, chief executive of the security-services company Riptech Inc. and a former information-security program director at the Defense Department. It is probably more feasible to implement and strongly enforce global security postures and practices rather than go out and purchase new assets, Yoran said. Once someone is able to get in, they will find a weak link. When you have a network the size of the government’s there will be weak links. Someone will get in.

    36.
    	
    According to the passage, what is Govnet?
    A) A reliable network infrastructure that can be built at an affordable price.  
    B) A government computer network that may prove immune to penetration.  
    C) A national security system to be developed by the government.  
    D) A private national security system to be developed against outside invasion.  

    正确答案： B
    37.
    	
    It is implied that some computer consultants consider Govnet to be almost impossible because ________.
    A) a considerable cost will be required  
    B) there isn’t a reliable network infrastructure yet  
    C) it is totally different from the Internet  
    D) no telecommunications company can afford it  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    By what means will Govnet realize the enhancement of the government’s cyber-security?
    A) By stepping up its virus-killing software.  
    B) By scanning for viruses and attacks constantly.  
    C) By secluding itself from the Internet.  
    D) By establishing an internal watchdog committee.  

    正确答案： C
    39.
    	
    What Amit Yoran said amounts to denying ________.
    A) the feasibility of building a security program  
    B) the efficiency of the present network in countering outside attacks  
    C) the conceived security of Govnet  
    D) the possibility of enhancing the security of the government network  

    正确答案： C
    40.
    	
    The initiative for constructing an internal network stems from ________.
    A) the vulnerability of the present network to outside attacks  
    B) the improvement in network security technology  
    C) the desire to build a stronger national defense system  
    D) the proposals submitted by telecommunications companies
