Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            There are two things I have always wanted to do ― write and live on a farm. Today I’m doing both. I am not in E. B. White’s class as a writer or in my neighbors’ league as a farmer, but I’m getting by. And after years of   21    with city and suburban living, my wife Sandy and I have finally found   22    here in the country.
            It’s a   23    sort of life. We grow nearly all of our fruits and vegetables. Our hens keep us in eggs, with several dozen left over to sell each week. Our bees provide us with honey, and we cut enough wood to just about   24    it _____ the heating season.
            It’s a   25    life too. In the summer we canoe on the river, go picnicking in the woods and take long bicycle rides. In the winter we ski and   26    . We get excited about sunsets. We love the   27    of the earth warming and the sound of cattle lowing. We watch for hawks in the sky and deer in the cornfields.
            But the good life can get pretty tough. Three months ago when it was 30 below, we spent two   28    days hauling firewood up the river on a sled. Three months from now, it will be 95 above and we will be   29    corn, weeding strawberries and killing chickens. Recently, Sandy and I had to retile the back roof. Soon Jim, 16 and Emily, 13, the youngest of our four children, will help me make some long-overdue improvements on the outdoor toilet that   30    our indoor plumbing when we are working outside. Later this month, we’ll spray the orchard, paint the barn, plant the garden and clean the hen house before the new chicks arrive.

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            The estimates of the numbers of home-schooled children vary widely. The U.S. Department of Education estimates there are 250,000 to 350,000 home-schooled children in the country. Home school advocates put the number much higher ― at about a million.
            Public schools take a harsh attitude toward home schoolers, perceiving their actions as the ultimate slap in the face for public education and a damaging move for the children. Home schoolers harbor few kind words for public schools, charging shortcomings that range from lack of religious perspective in the curriculum to a herdlike approach to teaching children.
            Yet, as public school officials realize they stand little to gain by remaining hostile to the home school population, and as home schoolers realize they can reap benefits from public schools, these hard lines seem to be softening a bit.
            Public schools and home schoolers have moved closer to tolerance and, in some cases even cooperation. Says John Marshall, an education official, "we are becoming relatively tolerant of home schoolers. The idea is, let’s give the kids access to public school so they’ll see it’s not as terrible as they’ve been told, and they’ll want to come back." Perhaps, but don’t count on it, say home school advocates.
            Home schoolers oppose the system because they have strong convictions that their approach to education ― whether fueled by religious enthusiasm or the individual child’s interest and natural pace ― is the best. "The bulk of home schoolers just want to be left alone." says Enge Cannon, associate director of the National Center for Home Education. She says home schoolers choose that path for a variety of reasons, but religion plays a role 85 percent of the time.
            Professor Van Galen breaks home schoolers into two groups. Some home schoolers want their children to learn not only traditional subject matter but also "strict religious doctrine (教条) and a conservative political and social perspective. Not incidentally, they also want their children to learn ― both intellectually and emotionally ― that the family is the most important institution in society." Other home schoolers contend "not so much that the schools teach heresy (异端邪说), but that schools teach whatever they teach inappropriately." Van Galen writes. "These parents are highly independent and strive to take responsibility for their own lives within a society that they define as bureaucratic (官僚主义) and inefficient."

    31.
    	
    Which of the following statements is true?
    A) Home schoolers engage private teachers to provide additional education for their children.  
    B) Home schoolers don’t go to school but are educated at home by their parents.  
    C) Home schoolers educate their children at home instead of sending them to school.  
    D) Home schoolers advocate combining public education with home schooling.  

    正确答案： C
    32.
    	
    Public schools are softening their position on home schooling because ________.
    A) they want to show their tolerance for different teaching systems  
    B) there isn’t much they can do to change the present situation  
    C) they have so many problems that they cannot offer proper education for all children  
    D) home schooling provides a new variety of education for children  

    正确答案： B
    33.
    	
    Most home schoolers’ opposition to public education stems from their _______.
    A) concern with the cost involved  
    B) worry about the inefficiency of public schools  
    C) devotion to religion  
    D) respect for the interests of individuals  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    From the passage we know that home school advocates think that ________.
    A) home schooling is superior and therefore they will not easily give in  
    B) their increased cooperation with public schools will bring about the improvement of public education  
    C) public schooling is not so bad as has often been said  
    D) their tolerance of public education will attract more kids to public schools  

    正确答案： A
    35.
    	
    It can be concluded from Van Galen’s research that some home schoolers believe that ________.
    A) teachers in public schools are not as responsible as they should be  
    B) public schools take up a herdlike approach to teaching children  
    C) public schools are the source of bureaucracy and inefficiency in modern society  
    D) public schools cannot provide education that is good enough for their children  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            It is well that young men should begin at the beginning and occupy the most subordinate positions. Many of the leading businessmen of Pittsburgh had a serious responsibility thrust upon them at the very threshold of their career. They were introduced to the broom, and spent the first hours of their business lives sweeping out the office. I notice we have janitors and janitresses now in offices, and our men unfortunately miss that beneficial branch of business education. But if by chance the professional sweeper is absent any morning, the boy who has the genius of the future partner in him will not hesitate to try his hand at the broom. It dose not hurt the newest comer to sweep out the office if necessary. I was one of those sweepers myself.
            Assuming that you have all obtained employment and are fairly started, my advice to you is "aim high." Say to yourself, "My place is at the top." Be king in your dreams. And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret: concentrate your energy, thought, and capital exclusively upon the business in which you are engaged. The concerns which fail are those which have scattered their capital, which means that they have scattered their brains also. "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" is all wrong. I tell you "put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket." Look around you and take notice; men who do that do not often fail. It is easy to watch and carry the one basket. It is trying to carry too many baskets that break most eggs in the country. He who carries three baskets must put one on his head, which is apt to tremble and trip (摔倒) him up.
