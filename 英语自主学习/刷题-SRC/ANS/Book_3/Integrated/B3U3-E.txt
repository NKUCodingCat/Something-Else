    Script:         Human rights groups say women suffer disproportionately from the global trade in small arms, considering that they are generally not the ones who buy and use guns. That’s according to a report issued ahead of International Women’s Day on Tuesday.
            The stories are uniformly horrifying, and they come from all over the world. A 19-year-old Iraqi woman is shot in the legs by her husband after she tried to escape their abusive relationship. A woman in the Solomon Islands is raped at gunpoint by a police commander. A schoolgirl in Brazil ends up in a wheelchair, after being caught in crossfire during an armed robbery.
            The report recommends that individual countries tighten gun-control laws, and demand licenses for anyone who wants to own a gun. It also recommends training police and other law enforcement officials to better understand and respect women’s situation when it comes to gun-related violence.

    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 25 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            Suburbs and country areas are, in many ways, even more   21    than well-patroled urban streets. Statistics show the crime rate rising more dramatically in those   22    tranquil areas than in cities.   23    , the era of leaving the front door on the latch is over.
            It has been   24    by dead-bolt locks, security chains, electronic alarm systems and trip wires hooked up to a police station or   25    guard firm. Many suburban families have sliding glass doors on their patios, with steel bars elegantly   26    so no one can pry the doors open.
            It is not uncommon, in the most pleasant of homes, to see   27    on the windows small notices   28    that the premises are under surveillance by this security force or that guard company.
            The lock is the new   29    of America. Indeed, a recent public-service advertisement by a large insurance company featured not charts showing how much at risk we are, but a picture of a child’s bicycle with the now-usual padlock   30    to it.

    A) private	B) built in	C) symbol	D) posted
    E) announcing	F) detached	G) pasted	H) attached

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            It was the worst tragedy in maritime (航海的) history, six times more deadly than the Titanic. When the German cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by torpedoes (鱼雷) fired from a Russian submarine in the final winter of World War II, more than 10,000 people ― mostly women, children and old people fleeing the final Red Army push into Nazi Germany ― were packed aboard. An ice storm had turned the decks into frozen sheets that sent hundreds of families sliding into the sea as the ship tilted and began to go down. Others desperately tried to put lifeboats down. Some who succeeded fought off those in the water who had the strength to try to claw their way aboard. Most people froze immediately. I’ll never forget the screams," says Christa Ntitzmann, 87, one of the 1,200 survivors. She recalls watching the ship, brightly lit, slipping into its dark grave ― and into seeming nothingness, rarely mentioned for more than half a century.
            Now Germany’s Nobel Prize-winning author Gtinter Grass has revived the memory of the 9,000 dead, including more than 4,000 children ― with his latest novel Crab Walk, published last month. The book, which will be out in English next year, doesn’t dwell on the sinking; its heroine is a pregnant young woman who survives the catastrophe only to say later: "Nobody wanted to hear about it, not here in the West (of Germany) and not at all in the East." The reason was obvious.    
            As Grass put it in a recent interview with the weekly Die Woche: "Because the crimes we Germans are responsible for were and are so dominant, we didn’t have the energy left to tell of our own sufferings."
            The long silence about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was probably unavoidable ― and necessary. By unreservedly owning up to their country’s monstrous crimes in the Second World War, Germans have managed to win acceptance abroad, marginalize (使……不得势) the neo-Nazis at home and make peace with their neighbors. Today’s unified Germany is more prosperous and stable than at any time in its long, troubled history. For that, a half century of willful forgetting about painful memories like the German Titanic was perhaps a reasonable price to pay. But even the most politically correct Germans believe that they’ve now earned the right to discuss the full historical record. Not to equate German suffering with that of its victims, but simply to acknowledge a terrible tragedy.

    31.

    A) It happened in the final winter of World War II.  
    B) It caused the largest number of casualties.

    B) they hope to be accepted by other countries  
    C) they only want to make the tragedy clear  
    D) they just show sympathy to the dead  

    正确答案： C

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Trade secrets cover everything that patents cover, and much more. A trade secret is knowledge, which may include business knowledge or technical knowledge, that is kept secret for the purpose of gaining an advantage in business over one's competitors. Customer lists, sources of supply of scarce material, or sources of supply with faster delivery or lower prices may be trade secrets. Certainly, secret processes, formulas, techniques, manufacturing know-how, advertising schemes, marketing programs, and business plans are all protectable.
            There is no standard of invention to meet as there is with a patent. If the idea is new in this context, if it is secret with respect to this particular industry or product, then it can be protected as a trade secret. Unlike patents, trademarks, and copyrights, there is no formal procedure for obtaining trade secret protection. Protection is established by the nature of the secret and the effort to keep it secret.
            A trade secret is protected eternally against disclosure by all those who have received it in confidence and all who would obtain it by theft for as long as the knowledge or information is kept secret. In contrast to patent protection, there are no statutory (法定的) requirements for novelty or restrictions on the subject matter.
            The disadvantage of trade secrets compared with patents is that there is no protection against discovery by fair means, such as accidental disclosure and independent inventions. Many important inventions, such as the laser and the airplane, were developed more or less simultaneously by different persons. Trade secret protection would not permit the first inventor to prevent the second and subsequent inventors from exploiting the invention as a patent would.



    36.
    	
    Compared with patents, trade secrets ______.
    A) are easier to protect  
    B) should meet certain standard of invention  
    C) need statutory support  
    D) cover a larger scope  

    正确答案： D
    37.

    A) M in McDonald  
    B) An employment contract  
    C) A Manual of Volkswagon  
    D) Formula  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    The protection of ______ becomes effective without any formal procedure.
    A) trade secrets  
    B) patents  
    C) copyrights  
    D) trademarks  

    正确答案： A
    39.
    	
    A trade secret doesn't have to be something ______.
    A) novel  
    B) unique  
    C) complicated  
    D) useful  

    正确答案： A
    40.
    	
    Unlike patents, ______.
    A) trade secrets can be obtained by others illegally  
    B) there might be more than one owner for one trade secret  
    C) trade secrets are often stolen by others  
    D) trade secrets are often disclosed to the public
