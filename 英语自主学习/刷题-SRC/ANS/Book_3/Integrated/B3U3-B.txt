            But no; with all this "security", we are perhaps the most   22    nation in the history of   23    man. What better word to   24    the way in which we have been forced to live? What sadder   25    on all that we have become in this new and puzzling time?

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            The government’s new cyber-security officials yesterday asked telecommunications companies for help in building a government computer network that would have no risk of outside penetration ― a task some computer security consultants say is nearly impossible. Plans for the private network, called Govnet, hinge on whether a reliable network infrastructure can be built at an affordable price, officials said. Computer system consultants said they could not estimate how much the network would cost because of the government’s enormous size and security needs. Richard Clarke, who was appointed special adviser to the president for cyberspace security this week, said he believes a more reliable system can be built. Ninety percent of available fiber-optic space is unused and fairly inexpensive to obtain, he said.
            Govnet is part of a plan Clarke announced earlier this week to secure our cyberspace from a range of possible threats, from hackers to criminals to terrorist groups, to foreign nations, which might use cyber-war against us in the future. Govnet would be completely independent from the Internet to help keep out hackers and viruses, according to the government’s plan. The request from the General Services Administration asks that telecommunications companies submit proposals about how the network could be built, how much it would cost, and how long it would take to construct.
            This year, the current network has been breached by hackers, computer worms and viruses. The system was also roughed up by the Code Red computer worm and an attack program called I Love You. The viruses affected thousands of government computers. Last year a report by the General Accounting Office, an internal government watchdog, found weaknesses in the computer network that could allow terrorists or hackers to severely damage or disrupt national defense or vital public operations or steal sensitive data. Clarke said the government's current virtual private network is vulnerable to viruses and denial-of-service attacks that would make it more difficult to execute Govnet.
            An internal network, such as the Govnet proposal, is worth investigating but will probably fall to sophisticated hackers, said Amit Yoran, chief executive of the security-services company Riptech Inc. and a former information-security program director at the Defense Department. It is probably more feasible to implement and strongly enforce global security postures and practices rather than go out and purchase new assets, Yoran said. Once someone is able to get in, they will find a weak link. When you have a network the size of the government’s there will be weak links. Someone will get in.

    31.
    	
    According to the passage, what is Govnet?
    A) A reliable network infrastructure that can be built at an affordable price.  
    B) A government computer network that may prove immune to penetration.  
    C) A national security system to be developed by the government.  
    D) A private national security system to be developed against outside invasion.  

    正确答案： B
    32.
    	
    It is implied that some computer consultants consider Govnet to be almost impossible because ________.
    A) a considerable cost will be required  
    B) there isn’t a reliable network infrastructure yet  
    C) it is totally different from the Internet  
    D) no telecommunications company can afford it  

    正确答案： A
    33.
    	
    By what means will Govnet realize the enhancement of the government’s cyber-security?
    A) By stepping up its virus-killing software.  
    B) By scanning for viruses and attacks constantly.  
    C) By secluding itself from the Internet.  
    D) By establishing an internal watchdog committee.  

    正确答案： C
    34.
    	
    What Amit Yoran said amounts to denying ________.
    A) the feasibility of building a security program  
    B) the efficiency of the present network in countering outside attacks  
    C) the conceived security of Govnet  
    D) the possibility of enhancing the security of the government network  

    正确答案： C
    35.
    	
    The initiative for constructing an internal network stems from ________.
    A) the vulnerability of the present network to outside attacks  
    B) the improvement in network security technology  
    C) the desire to build a stronger national defense system  
    D) the proposals submitted by telecommunications companies  

    正确答案： A

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.



            Too many vulnerable child-free adults are being ruthlessly (无情的) manipulated into parenthood by their parents, who think that happiness among older people depends on having a grandchild to spoil. We need an organization to help beat down the persistent campaigns of grandchildless parents. It’s time to establish Planned Grandparenthood, which would have many global and local benefits.
            Part of its mission would be to promote the risks and realities associated with being a grandparent. The staff would include depressed grandparents who would explain how grandkids break lamps, bite, scream and kick. Others would detail how an hour of baby-sitting often turns into a crying marathon. More grandparents would testify that they had to pay for their grandchild’s expensive college education.
            Planned Grandparenthood’s carefully written literature would detail all the joys of life grandchild-free: a calm living room, extra money for luxuries during the golden years, etc. Potential grandparents would be reminded that, without grandchildren around, it’s possible to have a conversation with your kids, who ― incidentally ― would have more time for their own parents. Meanwhile, most children are vulnerable to the enormous influence exerted by grandchildless parents aiming to persuade their kids to produce children. They will take a call from a persistent parent, even if they’re loaded with works. In addition, some parents make handsome money offers payable upon the grandchild’s birth. Sometimes these gifts not only cover expenses associated with the infant’s birth, but extras, too, like a vacation. In any case, cash gifts can weaken the resolve of even the noblest person.
            At Planned Grandparenthood, children targeted by their parents to reproduce could obtain non-biased information about the insanity of having their own kids. The catastrophic psychological and economic costs of childbearing would be emphasized.    
            The symptoms of morning sickness would be listed and horrors of childbirth pictured. A monthly newsletter would contain stories about overwhelmed parents and offer guidance on how childless adults can respond to the different lobbying tactics that would-be grandparents employ.
            When I think about all the problems of our overpopulated world and look at our boy grabbing at the lamp by the sofa, I wish I could have turned to Planned Grandparenthood when my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me.
            If I could have, I might not be in this parenthood predicament (窘境). But here’s the crazy irony, I don’t want my child-free life back. Dylan’s too much fun.

    36.
    	
    What’s the main purpose of the proposed organization Planned Grandparenthood?
    A) To provide effective tactics for the would-be grandparents.  
    B) To illustrate the happiness of grandchildless parents.  
    C) To provide facilities and services for grandchildless parents.  
    D) To discourage people from insisting on having grandchildren.  

    正确答案： D
    37.
    	
    Which of the following measure is NOT included by Planned Grandparenthood in realizing its goal?
    A) Inviting the depressed grandparents to emphasize the difficulties grandchildren may cause.  
    B) Stressing the joy and happiness of a grandchild-free life.  
    C) Guiding the childless couples how to struggle with their persistent parents.  
    D) Advocating family planning to alleviate the problems caused by overpopulation in the world.  

    正确答案： D
    38.
    	
    According to the passage, some couples may eventually choose to have children because ________.
    A) they find it hard to resist the carrot-and-stick approach of their parents  
    B) they have learnt from other parents about the joys of having children  
    C) they feel more and more lonely ad they grow older

    正确答案： A

    C) I enjoy my current life with a child  
    D) I wish my parents had never pressured me to have a child  

    正确答案： C
    40.

    A) It does more harm than good.
