    Script:         Psychologists take opposing views on how external rewards, from warm praise to cold cash, affect motivation and creativity. Behaviorists, who study the relation between actions and their consequences, argue that rewards can improve performance at work and school. Cognitive researchers, who study various aspects of mental life, maintain that rewards often destroy creativity by encouraging dependence on approval and gifts from others. The latter view has gained many supporters especially among educators. But the careful use of small monetary rewards sparks creativity in grade school children, suggesting that properly presented inducements indeed aid inventiveness, according to a study in the June Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. "If kids know they're working for a reward and can focus on a relatively challenging task, they show the most creativity," says Robert Eisenberger of the University of Delaware in Newark. But it's easy to kill creativity by giving rewards for poor performance or creating too much anticipation for rewards.

As an example of the latter point, he notes growing efforts at major universities to tighten grading standards and restore failing grades. In early grades, the use of so-called token economies, in which students handle changing problems and receive performance-based points toward valued rewards, shows promise in raising efforts and creativity, the Delaware psychologist claims.

    Part II    Reading Comprehension  ( 25 minutes ) 



    Section A 

    Directions: In this section, there is a passage with several blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.


            Although Einstein's five papers were published in a single year, he had been thinking about physics, deeply, since   21    . "Science was dinner-table conversation in the Einstein   22    ," explains Galison. Albert's father Hermann and uncle Jakob ran a German company making such things as dynamos, arc lamps,   23    and telephones. This was high-tech at the turn of the century, "like a Silicon Valley company would be today," notes Galison. "Albert's interest in science and technology came   24    ."
            Einstein's parents sometimes took Albert to parties. No babysitter was required: Albert sat on the couch, totally   25    , quietly doing math problems while others danced around him. Pencil and paper were Albert's GameBoy!
            He had   26    powers of concentration. Einstein's sister, Maja, recalled "... even when there was a lot of noise, he could   27    on the sofa, pick up a pen and paper,   28    balance an inkwell on the backrest and   29    himself in a problem so much that the background noise   30    rather than disturbed him."

    A) engross	B) mess	C) household	D) revolutionize
    E) outbreak	F) naturally	G) beholden	H) undermine
    I) impressive	J) lie down	K) light bulbs	L) precariously

    Section B 

    Directions: There are several passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice.


    Passage One
    Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.



            Our culture has caused most Americans to assume not only that our language is universal but that the gestures we use are understood by everyone. We do not realize that waving good-bye is the way to summon a person to one's side in the Philippines, or that in Italy and some Latin-American countries, curling the finger to oneself is a sign of farewell.
            Those private citizens who sent packages to our troops occupying Germany after World War II and marked them GIFT to escape duty payments did not bother to find out that "Gift" means poison in German. Moreover, we like to think of ourselves as friendly, yet we prefer to be at least 3 feet or an arm's length away from others. Latins and Middle Easterners like to come closer and touch, which makes Americans uncomfortable.
            Our linguistic and cultural blindness and the casualness with which we take notice of the developed tastes, gestures, customs and language of other countries, are losing us friends, business and respect in the world.
            Even here in the United States, we make few concessions to the needs of foreign visitors. There are no information signs in four language on our public buildings or monuments; we do not have multilingual (多语的) guided tours. Very few restaurant menus have translations, and multilingual waiters, bank clerks and policemen are rare. Our transportation systems have maps in English only and often we ourselves have difficulty understanding them.
            When we go abroad, we tend to cluster in hotels and restaurants where English is spoken. The attitudes and information we pick up are conditioned by those natives ― usually the richer ― who speak English. Our business dealings, as well as the nation's diplomacy, are conducted through interpreters.
            For many years, America and Americans could get by with cultural blindness and linguistic ignorance. After all, America was the most powerful country of the world, the distributor of needed funds and goods.
            But all that is past. American dollars no longer buy all good things, and we are slowly beginning to realize that our proper role in the world is changing. A 1979 Harris poll reported that 55 percent of Americans want this country to play a more significant role in world affairs; we want to have a hand in the important decisions of the next century, even tough it may not always be the upper hand.

    31.
    	
    It can be inferred that Americans being approached too closely by Middle Easterners would most probably ________.
    A) stand still  
    B) jump aside  
    C) step forward  
    D) draw back  

    正确答案： D
    32.

    33.

    A) are isolated by the local people  
    B) are not well informed due to the language barrier  
    C) tend to get along well with the natives  
    D) need interpreters in hotels and restaurants  

    正确答案： B
    34.
    	
    According to the author, American's cultural blindness and linguistic ignorance will _______.
    A) affect their image in the new era  
    B) cut themselves off from the outside world  
    C) limit their role in world affairs  
    D) weaken the position of the US dollar  

    正确答案： C
    35.

    A) it is dangerous to ignore their foreign friends  
    B) it is important to maintain their leading role in world affairs  
    C) it is necessary to use several languages in public places  
    D) it is time to get acquainted with other cultures  

    正确答案： D

    Passage Two
    Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.

            Art is considered by many people to be little more than a decorative means of giving pleasure. This is not always the case, however; at times, art may be seen to have a purely functional side as well. Such could be said of the sand-paintings of the Navaho of the American Southwest; these have a medical as well as an artistic
    purpose.
            According to Navaho traditions, one who suffers from either a mental or a physical illness has in some way disturbed or come in contact with the supernatural (超自然的) ― perhaps a certain animal, a ghost, or the dead. To counteract this evil contact, the ill person or one of his relatives will employ a medicine man called a "singer" to perform a healing ceremony which will attract a powerful supernatural being. During the ceremony, which may last from 2 to 9 days，the "singer" will produce a sand painting on the floor of the Navaho house. On the last day of the ceremony, the patient will sit on this sand painting and the "singer" will rub the sick parts of the patient's body with sand. In this way the patient absorbs the power of that particular supernatural being and becomes strong like it. After the ceremony, the sand painting is then destroyed so its power will not harm anyone.
            The art of sand painting is handed down from old "singers" to their students. The materials used are easily found in the areas the Navaho inhabit: brown, red, yellow, and white sandstone, which is ground into powder by being crushed between 2 stones much as corn is ground into flour. The "singer" holds a small amount of this sand in his hand and lets it flow between his thumb and forefinger onto a clean, flat surface on the floor. With a steady hand and great patience, he is thus able to create designs of people, snakes and other creatures that have power in Navaho belief system.



    36.
    	
    Which of the following refers to the same thing as "decorative" in Para. 1?
    A) Functional.

    B) a dead goat  
    C) any animal  
    D) too many dead people  

    正确答案： A
    38.
    	
    How can a sick person recover from his illness according to the passage?
    A) He must avoid the evil contact.  
    B) He needs help from another powerful supernatural being.  
    C) He must draw a sand painting.  
    D) He must sing at a ceremony.  

    正确答案： B
    39.
    	
    The reason for the sand painting to be destroyed after the ceremony is ________.
    A) not to allow others to use it freely  
    B) to harm the patient  
    C) not to harm others  
    D) to protect the patient  

    正确答案： C
    40.

    B) They attract supernatural beings.
